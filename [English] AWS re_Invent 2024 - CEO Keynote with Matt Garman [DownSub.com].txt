PLEASE WELCOME THE CEO OF AWS
MATT GARMAN.

[MUSIC]
HELLO EVERYONE, AND WELCOME TO

THE 13TH ANNUAL AWS RE:INVENT.
SO AWESOME TO SEE YOU ALL HERE.

NOW THIS IS MY FIRST EVENT AS
CEO, BUT IT'S NOT MY FIRST

RE:INVENT. I'VE ACTUALLY HAD THE
PRIVILEGE TO HAVE BEEN TO BE TO

EVERY RE:INVENT SINCE 2012. NOW,
13 YEARS INTO THIS EVENT, A LOT

HAS CHANGED. BUT WHAT HASN'T IS
WHAT MAKES RE:INVENT SO SPECIAL.

BRINGING TOGETHER THE
PASSIONATE, ENERGETIC AWS

COMMUNITY TO LEARN FROM EACH
OTHER. JUST HEARING YOU THIS

MORNING AND AS YOU WALK THROUGH
THE HALLS, YOU CAN FEEL THE

ENERGY AND I ENCOURAGE YOU ALL
TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS WEEK

TO LEARN FROM EACH OTHER. THIS
YEAR WE HAVE ALMOST 60,000

PEOPLE HERE IN PERSON AND
ANOTHER 400,000 WATCHING ONLINE.

THANK YOU TO EVERYONE WHO'S
WATCHING. AND WE HAVE IN PERSON

HERE. WE HAVE 1900 SESSIONS FOR
YOU ALL TO ATTEND AND ALMOST

3500 SPEAKERS AND MANY OF THOSE
SPEAKERS AND SESSIONS ARE LED BY

CUSTOMERS, PARTNERS AND AWS
EXPERTS, MANY OF WHOM ARE IN THE

AUDIENCE TODAY. THANK YOU SO
MUCH. YOU'RE SHARING YOUR

CONTENT AND YOUR EXPERTISE IS
WHAT MAKES RE:INVENT SO SPECIAL.

THANK YOU.
[APPLAUSE]

NOW, RE:INVENT HAS SOMETHING FOR
EVERYBODY. IT HAS STUFF FOR

TECHNOLOGISTS, FOR EXECUTIVES,
FOR PARTNERS, STUDENTS AND MORE.

BUT AT ITS CORE, RE:INVENT IS A
LEARNING CONFERENCE REALLY TO

DEDICATED BUILDERS AND
SPECIFICALLY TO DEVELOPERS. IN

FACT, ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS
THAT I DID WHEN I TOOK OVER THIS

ROLE WAS TO SPEND A LITTLE BIT
OF TIME WITH OUR AWS HEROES.

[APPLAUSE]
A SHOUT OUT TO THE HEROES WHO I

BELIEVE ARE SITTING OVER HERE. I
CAN HEAR THEM ALREADY. OUR

HEROES ARE SOME OF OUR MOST
DEDICATED AND PASSIONATE AWS

DEVELOPERS. THANK YOU SO MUCH.
AND THE WAY THE WHOLE AWS

DEVELOPER COMMUNITY HAS GROWN IS
REALLY INCREDIBLE. WE NOW HAVE

600 USER GROUPS ALL AROUND THE
WORLD, SPANNING 120 DIFFERENT

COUNTRIES AND THE ENTIRE AWS
COMMUNITY IS MANY MILLIONS ALL

COUNTRIES AND THE ENTIRE AWS
COMMUNITY IS MANY MILLIONS ALL

AROUND THE WORLD. AND ONE OF THE
GREAT THINGS ABOUT THAT

COMMUNITY IS WE GET FEEDBACK
FROM YOU THAT GOES DIRECTLY INTO

THE PRODUCTS AND INFORMS WHAT WE
BUILD AND ANNOUNCE HERE TODAY.

SO THANK YOU. NOW IN 2006 IS
WHEN I FIRST STARTED AWS, AND AT

AWS, WHEN WE LAUNCHED THE
BUSINESS AND OUR VERY FIRST

CUSTOMERS WERE STARTUPS. SO
STARTUPS HAVE A REALLY SPECIAL

PLACE IN MY HEART AND ONE OF THE
THINGS THAT I LOVE ABOUT

STARTUPS IS THEY ARE ANXIOUS TO
USE NEW TECHNOLOGIES. THEY WILL

JUMP IN AND THEY GIVE US GREAT
FEEDBACK. THEY PUSH US TO

INNOVATE, THEY INNOVATE ON TOP
OF US, AND THEY MOVE REALLY

FAST. AND WE LEARN A TON FROM
STARTUPS. NOW WITH GENERATIVE

AI, THERE IS NEVER A MORE
EXCITING TIME OUT THERE IN THE

WORLD TO BE A STARTUP.
GENERATIVE AI HAS THE POTENTIAL

TO DISRUPT EVERY SINGLE INDUSTRY
OUT THERE, AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT

DISRUPTORS, DISRUPTION COMES
FROM STARTUPS. AND SO IT'S A

FANTASTIC TIME IF YOU'RE A
STARTUP, TO REALLY BE THINKING

ABOUT HOW YOU DISRUPT
INDUSTRIES. IN FACT, WE SUPPORT

STARTUPS SO MUCH. I'M EXCITED TO
ANNOUNCE THAT IN 2025, AWS WILL

PROVIDE $1 BILLION IN CREDITS TO
STARTUPS GLOBALLY. AS WE

CONTINUE TO INVEST IN YOUR
SUCCESS.

[APPLAUSE]
NOW, WHILE STARTUPS WERE OUR

FIRST CUSTOMERS, IT ACTUALLY
DIDN'T TAKE LONG FOR ENTERPRISES

TO CATCH ON. AND SO ENTERPRISES
QUICKLY REALIZED THERE'S A TON

OF VALUE IN THE CLOUD. AND
TODAY, THE LARGEST ENTERPRISES

ACROSS EVERY SINGLE INDUSTRY IN
THE WORLD, EVERY SINGLE

VERTICAL, EVERY SINGLE SIZE,
EVERY SINGLE GOVERNMENT ARE

RUNNING ON AWS. MILLIONS OF
CUSTOMERS RUNNING IN EVERY

IMAGINABLE USE CASE. BUT IT
WASN'T ACTUALLY ALWAYS THIS WAY.

SO ONE STORY FROM EARLY ON I'D
LIKE TO SHARE. IS IT WAS EARLY

ON IN OUR AWS JOURNEY, AND WE
TOOK A TRIP TO NEW YORK TO VISIT

SOME OF THE BANKS, AND THEY WERE
REALLY INTERESTED IN WHAT THIS

WHOLE CLOUD COMPUTING THING WAS.
AND SO WE SAT DOWN WITH THEM AND

THEY WERE THEY WERE VERY
CURIOUS. AND WE OUTLINED OUR

VISION FOR HOW CLOUD COMPUTING
COULD CHANGE HOW THEY DO RUN

THEIR IT AND RUN THEIR
TECHNOLOGY. AND THEY TOLD US,

THEY SAID, YOU KNOW WHAT? I
THINK IT'S VERY UNLIKELY THAT

ANY OF OUR PRODUCTION WORKLOADS
ARE EVER GOING TO RUN IN THE

CLOUD. AND THEY SAT DOWN AND
THEY WERE VERY DILIGENT, AND

THEY GAVE US A WHOLE LIST OF
REASONS. THERE'S COMPLIANCE,

THERE'S AUDIT, THERE'S
REGULATORY, THERE'S SECURITY,

THERE'S ENCRYPTION. ALL OF THESE
THINGS WERE REASONS WHY THEY

WOULD LOVE TO. IT'S A COMPELLING
TECHNOLOGY, BUT PROBABLY NEVER

GOING TO RUN IN THE CLOUD. SO IT
WOULD HAVE BEEN SUPER EASY FOR

TO US SAY, OKAY, GUESS THAT'S
NOT WORTH OUR TIME AND GO TO THE

NEXT CUSTOMER. BUT THAT'S NOT
WHAT WE DID. AND ACTUALLY, I'D

LOVE TO THANK THOSE FINANCIAL
SERVICES CUSTOMERS THAT WE SAT

DOWN WITH BECAUSE THEY REALLY
HELPED US UNDERSTAND WHAT IT

WOULD TAKE TO SUPPORT LARGE,
REGULATED CUSTOMERS INSIDE OF

THE CLOUD. AND AS AWS, WE REALLY
WANTED TO SUPPORT EVERY

CUSTOMER. SO WE SPENT THE BETTER
PART OF THE NEXT DECADE TICKING

EVERY SINGLE THING OFF OF THOSE
LISTS. AND I'M PROUD TO SAY THAT

EVERY SINGLE THING OFF OF THOSE
LISTS. AND I'M PROUD TO SAY THAT

MANY OF THOSE LARGE FINANCIAL
COMPANIES ARE CUSTOMERS OF OURS

TODAY. AND SO, YOU KNOW, WHEN
YOU'RE INNOVATING, ONE OF THE

IMPORTANT THINGS TO REMEMBER IS
YOU REALLY WANT TO START WITH

THE CUSTOMER. YOU WANT TO ASK
THEM WHAT'S IMPORTANT TO THEM,

BUT THEN YOU DON'T JUST ALWAYS
JUST DELIVER WHAT THE CUSTOMER

ASKS FOR. YOU WANT TO INVENT ON
THEIR BEHALF. WE CALL THIS THE

AMAZON IS STARTING WITH THE
CUSTOMER AND WORKING BACKWARDS,

LISTENING TO THEM UNDERSTANDING
WHAT THEY WANT, AND THEN WORK

BACKWARDS TO WHAT'S A FANTASTIC
PRODUCT AND THAT CUSTOMER FOCUS

AND WORKING BACKWARDS IS REALLY
PART OF OUR AWS, DNA, AND IT'S

HOW WE APPROACH THE BUSINESS
FROM THE VERY BEGINNING. IN

FACT, THE ORIGINAL AWS VISION
DOCUMENT THAT WE WROTE WAS

WRITTEN IN 2003, AND AT THE
TIME, THERE WAS A LOT OF

TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES THAT WERE
BUILDING THESE BUNDLED SOLUTIONS

THAT WOULD TRY TO DO EVERYTHING
FOR YOU AND WHAT THEY ENDED UP

DOING IS THERE WERE THESE BIG
MONOLITHIC SOLUTIONS THAT WOULD

DO EVERYTHING FINE. IT WAS GOOD
ENOUGH, AND WE HAD THIS

OBSERVATION THAT GOOD ENOUGH
SHOULDN'T BE ALL YOU STRIVE FOR.

YOU WANT THE BEST POSSIBLE
COMPONENT. IT WOULD BE GREAT IF

YOU COULD TAKE THE LITTLE BIT OF
EVERYTHING THAT WAS BEST AND

COMBINE THEM TOGETHER. AND WITH
THAT IDEA, AWS WAS BORN AND WE

MADE THIS OTHER OBSERVATION. YOU
COULD TAKE ALMOST ANY

APPLICATION OUT THERE AND YOU
COULD BREAK IT DOWN INTO

INDIVIDUAL COMPONENTS. IT COULD
BE DECOMPOSED INTO THESE CORE

SERVICES. AND WE CALL THESE CORE
SERVICES BUILDING BLOCKS. AND

THIS IDEA WAS THAT IF YOU HAD
THESE SERVICES THAT WERE THE

BEST IN THE WORLD AT DOING THIS
ONE SPECIFIC THING, AND THEY DID

THAT JOB REALLY, REALLY WELL,
AND YOU MADE IT EASY TO COMBINE

A BUNCH OF THESE SERVICES
TOGETHER IN NEW AND UNIQUE WAYS.

THEN PEOPLE COULD REALLY BUILD
INTERESTING THINGS, AND YOU'D

HAVE A BETTER MODEL FOR HOW TO
CONSUME TECHNOLOGY AND HOW TO

BUILD COMPANIES. NOW, THIS
BUILDING BLOCK CONCEPT HAS BEEN

FUNDAMENTAL TO HOW WE BUILD AWS
SERVICES OVER THE LAST 18 YEARS,

AND TODAY WE HAVE HUNDREDS OF
AWS SERVICES THAT YOU ALL

COMBINED IN UNIQUE AND DIFFERENT,
INTERESTING AND INCREDIBLE WAYS.

SO ONE OF THE THINGS I THOUGHT
WOULD BE PRETTY FUN IS

THROUGHOUT THE DAY TODAY IS TO
HEAR FROM SOME STARTUP FOUNDERS

WHO ARE TAKING THESE BUILDING
BLOCKS AND COMBINING THEM IN

COOL AND INTERESTING WAYS TO
REDEFINE HOW PROBLEMS GET SOLVED

IN THEIR SPACE. LET'S HEAR FROM
THE FIRST ONE OF THESE FOUNDERS.

NOW.
[MUSIC]

PROTEINS HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO
SOLVE SOME OF THE MOST IMPORTANT

CHALLENGES FACING OUR SOCIETIES.
MANY IMPORTANT DRUGS OR PROTEINS.

EVOLUTIONARY SCALE DEVELOPS AI
FOR THE LIFE SCIENCES. WE HAVE

DEVELOPED THE ESM FAMILY OF
MODELS WHICH ARE USED BY

SCIENTISTS AROUND THE WORLD TO
UNDERSTAND AND DESIGN PROTEINS.

[MUSIC]
AS SOON AS WE FOUNDED THE

COMPANY, OUR FIRST COMPUTE WAS
ON AWS AND WE WERE EARLY USERS

OF HYPERPOD. THIS ALLOWED TO US
DO THE ITERATIVE DEVELOPMENT

THAT WAS CRITICAL FOR CREATING
ESM3. ESM3 IS A MODEL THAT

REASONS OVER THE SEQUENCE
STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION OF

PROTEINS. IT'S BEEN TRAINED ON A
TRILLION TERAFLOPS OF COMPUTE ON

OVER 2 BILLION PROTEIN SEQUENCES
THROUGH THIS TRAINING, IT'S

DEVELOPED A VERY DEEP
UNDERSTANDING OF THE BIOLOGY OF

PROTEINS THAT ALLOWS SCIENTISTS
TO THEN GO IN AND PROMPT THE

MODEL AND BE ABLE TO CREATE NEW
PROTEINS. WHAT THIS MEANS IS

THAT WE COULD ENGINEER PROTEINS
THE WAY THAT WE ENGINEER OTHER

SYSTEMS, LIKE MICROCHIPS AND
BUILDINGS. AND SO ESM3 IS A STEP

TOWARD MAKING BIOLOGY
PROGRAMABLE TO BRING TOGETHER

THE FRONTIER TOOLS THAT
EVOLUTIONARY SCALE IS DEVELOPING

WITH THE SECURITY AND
ORCHESTRATION THAT AWS BRINGS.

WE COULD HAVE A SOLUTION THAT
COULD SCALE IN THE

PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY AS WE
CONTINUE TO SCALE THESE MODELS

UP, THEY'LL DEVELOP A DEEPER AND
DEEPER UNDERSTANDING OF BIOLOGY

AND HELP US TO UNDERSTAND THE
NATURAL WORLD AND LIFE IN A NEW

WAY.
[APPLAUSE]

IT'S ACTUALLY MIND BLOWING AND
REALLY INCREDIBLE WHAT THE TEAM

AT EVOLUTIONARY SCALE IS
BUILDING. REALLY COOL. THANK

YOU. AND NOW THERE ARE A LOT OF
REASONS WHY CUSTOMERS CHOOSE AWS

AND BUT THERE IS ONE THING THAT
ALMOST EVERYBODY REALLY CARES A

LOT ABOUT, FROM STARTUPS TO
ENTERPRISES TO GOVERNMENTS. AND

WHAT THAT IS, IS SECURITY. NOW,
WHEN WE STARTED AWS, WE

UNDERSTOOD FROM DAY ONE THAT
SECURITY WAS GOING TO HAVE TO BE

OUR TOP PRIORITY. WE KNEW THAT
YOU ALL WERE TRUSTING US WITH

YOUR DATA. YOU'RE BUILDING YOUR
BUSINESS ON TOP OF US, AND

THAT'S A RESPONSIBILITY THAT WE
TOOK REALLY SERIOUSLY. AND SO

FOR US, WE KNEW THAT THAT
SECURITY HAD TO BE THE

FOUNDATION OF WHAT WE BUILT THAT
BUSINESS ON. AND SO FOR US, PART

OF WHAT WE UNDERSTOOD IS THAT
SECURITY IS PART OF YOUR

CULTURE, RIGHT? IT'S SOMETHING
THAT YOU CAN'T BOLT ON AFTER THE

FACT, RIGHT? IT'S NOT SOMETHING
THAT YOU CAN GO LAUNCH AND THEN

ADD SECURITY. YOU HAVE TO DO IT
FROM THE BEGINNING. AND SO FOR

US, SECURITY MATTERS IN EVERY
SINGLE THING THAT WE DO. IT

MATTERS IN HOW WE DESIGN OUR
DATA CENTERS. IT MATTERS IN HOW

WE DESIGN OUR SILICON. IT
MATTERS IN HOW WE DESIGN OUR

VIRTUALIZATION STACK IN OUR
SERVICE ARCHITECTURES AND MAYBE

MOST IMPORTANTLY, IN ALL OF OUR
SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT PRACTICES,

WHERE SECURITY HAS TO BE FRONT
AND CENTER FROM THE VERY

BEGINNING, FROM THE DESIGN PHASE
TO THE IMPLEMENTATION PHASE TO

THE DEPLOYMENT PHASE, THE
PATCHING, ETC. SUPER IMPORTANT.

EVERYTHING STARTS WITH SECURITY,
TOP OF MIND AND WITH AWS.

SECURITY IS ONE OF THE REASONS
THAT SO MANY CUSTOMERS ARE

TRUSTING AWS WITH THEIR CLOUD
WORKLOADS. IT'S THIS CORE

FOUNDATIONAL LAYER THAT ALL OF
THE REST OF OUR SERVICES KIND OF

BUILD ON TOP OF. ALL RIGHT,
SPEAKING OF ONE OF THOSE

BUILDING BLOCKS, LET'S JUMP IN
AND TALK ABOUT THE FIRST ONE.

COMPUTE. NOW, TODAY, AWS OFFERS
MORE COMPUTE INSTANCES THAN ANY

OTHER PROVIDER BY A LONG SHOT.
AND IT ALL STARTED WITH EC2.

NOW, SOME OF YOU MIGHT KNOW I
ACTUALLY USED TO LEAD THE EC2

TEAM FOR MANY YEARS NOW IN MY
CURRENT ROLE. TECHNICALLY, I'M

PROBABLY NOT ALLOWED TO SAY I
HAVE FAVORITES, BUT I REALLY

LOVE EC2. THE GOOD NEWS IS LOTS
OF CUSTOMERS LOVE IT TOO. AND

WHY? BECAUSE EC2 HAS MORE
OPTIONS, MORE INSTANCES, AND

MORE CAPABILITIES, AND IT HELPS
YOU FIND THE EXACT RIGHT

PERFORMANCE FOR THE APP OR FOR
YOUR WORKLOAD THAT YOU NEED. IN

FACT, AT THIS POINT, WE'VE GROWN
TO WHERE EC2 HAS 850 DIFFERENT

INSTANCE TYPES ACROSS 126
DIFFERENT FAMILIES. WHAT THAT

MEANS IS YOU CAN ALWAYS FIND THE
EXACT RIGHT INSTANCE TYPE FOR

THE WORKLOAD THAT YOU NEED. SO
IF YOU'RE RUNNING, SAY, A BIG

DATABASE OR AN ANALYTICS
WORKLOAD, WE HAVE THE LARGEST

STORAGE INSTANCES THAT YOU CAN
RUN ANYWHERE IN THE CLOUD. LET'S

SAY YOU HAVE AN APP THAT HAS
IN-MEMORY REQUIREMENTS. WE HAVE

THE INSTANCES WITH THE LARGEST
FOOTPRINT ANYWHERE. FOR THOSE

LATENCY SENSITIVE NEEDS THAT YOU
HAVE. NOW, LET'S SAY YOU'RE

RUNNING AN HPC CLUSTER OR A
LARGE AI AND ML CLUSTER, AND YOU

NEED REALLY FAST NETWORKING TO
CONNECT ALL OF THOSE NODES

TOGETHER. AWS HAS BY FAR THE
FASTEST AND MOST SCALABLE TO

NETWORK KEEP ALL OF YOUR HPC
INSTANCES OR ML INSTANCES

TOGETHER, AND WE WORK HARD TO
ENSURE THAT YOU ALWAYS HAVE THE

LATEST TECHNOLOGY, SO YOU ALWAYS
HAVE INSTANCES WITH THE LATEST

ADVANCEMENTS FROM INTEL OR AMD
OR NVIDIA, AND AWS WAS THE FIRST

AND CONTINUES TO BE THE ONLY
CLOUD THAT OFFERS MAC BASED

INSTANCES. SO ONE QUESTION THAT
I GET FROM A LOT OF CUSTOMERS

IS, HOW DO YOU POSSIBLY SUSTAIN
THAT LEVEL OF INNOVATION? WHAT

ALLOWS YOU TO DELIVER SO MUCH?
ONE OF THE ANSWERS TO THAT IS

NITRO. NITRO IS OUR AWS
VIRTUALIZATION SYSTEM.

EFFECTIVELY, WHAT WE DID IS WE
DESIGNED A CUSTOM CHIP THAT

OFFLOADS ALL OF THE
VIRTUALIZATION FOR NETWORKING,

FOR STORAGE, AND FROM COMPUTE
OFF INTO THIS SEPARATE NITRO

CARD SYSTEM. YOU SEE UP HERE.
WHAT THAT ALLOWS US TO DO IS IT

ALLOWS US TO DELIVER BARE METAL
PERFORMANCE. IT ALLOWS US TO

DELIVER UNPARALLELED SECURITY
AND ISOLATION FOR CUSTOMERS.

THAT'S UNMATCHED ANYWHERE IN THE
CLOUD. BUT AN INTERESTING OTHER

BENEFIT OF NITRO IS IT GIVES US
A TON OF FLEXIBILITY. SEE, WHEN

WE MOVE ALL OF THE
VIRTUALIZATION OFF INTO THIS

NITRO SYSTEM SEPARATELY, IT
ALLOWS US TO INNOVATE

INDEPENDENTLY. SO WE DON'T HAVE
TO REDO THE VIRTUALIZATION

STACK. EVERY TIME WE HAVE A NEW
INSTANCE TYPE, WE CAN SIMPLY

DEVELOP A GREAT NEW SERVER AND
DEVELOP THE VIRTUALIZATION STACK

INDEPENDENTLY AND PUT THEM
TOGETHER. THAT ALLOWS US TO MOVE

MUCH FASTER. AND IT'S
INTERESTING. NITRO HAS BEEN ONE

OF THE KEYS THAT HAS REALLY
UNLOCKED THE SPEED OF INNOVATION

IN COMPUTE. IN AWS. THE OTHER
INTERESTING THING ABOUT NITRO IS

IT REALLY TAUGHT US ABOUT
DEVELOPING CUSTOM SILICON, AND

WITH THE SUCCESS OF NITRO, WE
SAW WE CAN BE SUCCESSFUL AT

BUILDING SILICON. AND SO WE
LOOKED AT WHERE ELSE MAYBE WE

COULD APPLY THIS SKILL. NOW, IN
2018, WE SAW A TREND IN COMPUTE.

WE WERE LOOKING OUT THERE AND WE
SAW THAT ARM CORES WERE GETTING

FASTER. MOST OF THEM WERE IN
MOBILE, BUT THEY WERE GETTING

MORE POWERFUL. AND WE HAD THIS
IDEA THAT THERE'S THIS

OPPORTUNITY THAT MAYBE WE COULD
GO COMBINE THAT TECHNOLOGY CURVE

WITH OUR KNOWLEDGE OF WHAT'S
MOST IMPORTANT TO CUSTOMERS

RUNNING INSIDE OF AWS AND
DEVELOP A CUSTOM, GENERAL

PURPOSE PROCESSOR. NOW, AT THE
TIME, THIS WAS A VERY

CONTROVERSIAL IDEA, RIGHT?
BECAUSE THAT SEEMS CRAZY THAT WE

WOULD GO DEVELOP OUR OWN SILICON,
BUT WE WERE PRETTY CONVICTED

THAT WE COULD DELIVER REALLY
DIFFERENTIATED VALUE TO

CUSTOMERS. AND SO WE DOVE IN AND
WE LAUNCHED GRAVITON. FAST

FORWARD TO TODAY. GRAVITON IS
WIDELY USED BY ALMOST EVERY AWS

CUSTOMER OUT THERE. GRAVITON
DELIVERS 40% BETTER PRICE

PERFORMANCE THAN X86. IT USES
60% LESS ENERGY THAT IS

FANTASTIC. SO YOU CAN BOTH
REDUCE YOUR CARBON FOOTPRINT AND

GET BETTER PRICE PERFORMANCE.
AND GRAVITON IS GROWING LIKE

CRAZY. LET'S PUT THIS INTO
CONTEXT. IN 2019, ALL OF AWS WAS

A $35 BILLION BUSINESS. TODAY,
THERE'S AS MUCH GRAVITON RUNNING

IN THE AWS FLEET AS ALL COMPUTE
IN 2019. IT'S PRETTY IMPRESSIVE

GROWTH. A FEW MONTHS AGO, WE
LAUNCHED GRAVITON4. GRAVITON

FOUR IS THE MOST POWERFUL
GRAVITON CHIP YET. AND NOW WITH

THIS MORE POWERFUL CHIP,
GRAVITON CAN ADDRESS A MUCH

BROADER SET OF WORKLOADS,
INCLUDING THINGS LIKE SCALE UP

WORKLOADS LIKE DATABASES OR
OTHER THINGS THAT NEED REALLY

LARGE INSTANCES. GRAVITON4
DELIVERS 30% MORE POWER COMPUTE

POWER PER CORE, BUT IT ALSO HAS
THREE TIMES THE NUMBER OF VCPUS

AS GRAVITON3, AS WELL AS THREE X
THE MEMORY. SO YOU CAN GET MUCH

LARGER INSTANCE SIZES. AND IT'S
NOT JUST MORE INSTANCE SIZES AND

BIGGER INSTANCE SIZES. GRAVITON
IS REALLY HAVING A MATERIAL

IMPACT ON CUSTOMERS BUSINESSES.
LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT SOMEBODY

LIKE PINTEREST. NOW PINTEREST
WAS RUNNING THOUSANDS OF X86

INSTANCES TO RUN THEIR BUSINESS,
AND THEY MADE THE DECISION TO

MOVE TO GRAVITON WHEN THEY
MOVED. NOT ONLY DID THEY SEE

THAT THEY HAD LOWER PRICING FOR
GRAVITON, THEY ACTUALLY GOT

ABSOLUTELY BETTER PERFORMANCE
FROM EVERY INSTANCE. SO THEY'RE

ACTUALLY ABLE TO REDUCE THEIR
FOOTPRINT. THIS MEANS THAT

BECAUSE OF GRAVITON THEY REDUCED
THEIR COMPUTE COSTS BY 47%.

THERE IS NOT A LOT OF THINGS OUT
THERE THAT YOU CAN DO THAT CAN

REDUCE THE COST OF YOUR ENTIRE
COMPUTE FOOTPRINT BY 47%. IT'S

PRETTY INCREDIBLE. AND BECAUSE
PINTEREST CARES A TON ABOUT HOW

ENERGY EFFICIENT THEY ARE, THEY
CUT THEIR CARBON EMISSIONS BY

62%. AND THEY'RE NOT ALONE. 90%
OF THE TOP 1000 EC2 CUSTOMERS

HAVE ALL STARTED USING GRAVITON.
IT'S AWESOME TO SEE SO MANY

CUSTOMERS BENEFITING FROM THIS
INNOVATION.

[APPLAUSE]
BUT I WILL TELL YOU, TIME DOES

NOT STAND STILL. AND IF THERE
HAS BEEN ONE CONSTANT IN MY TIME

AT AWS, IT'S THAT WORKLOADS ARE
CONSTANTLY EVOLVING, WHICH MEANS

CUSTOMERS ARE LOOKING TO US TO
SAY, HOW CAN YOU COME UP WITH

BETTER SOLUTIONS FOR THESE NEW
WORKLOADS? AND TODAY, BY FAR THE

BIGGEST COMPUTE PROBLEM OUT
THERE INVOLVE AI AND

SPECIFICALLY GENERATIVE AI. NOW,
THE VAST MAJORITY OF GENERATIVE

AI WORKLOADS TODAY RUN ON NVIDIA
GPUS, AND AWS IS BY FAR THE BEST

PLACE IN ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD
TO RUN GPU WORKLOADS. PART OF

THE REASON IS BECAUSE AWS AND
NVIDIA HAVE BEEN COLLABORATING

TOGETHER FOR 14 YEARS TO ENSURE
THAT WE'RE REALLY GREAT AT ABOUT

OPERATING AND RUNNING GPU
WORKLOADS. JUST THIS LAST YEAR,

WE LAUNCHED G6 INSTANCES. G6 IS
P5 NS, ALL POWERED BY NVIDIA

TENSOR CORE GPUS NOW. IN FACT,
BECAUSE AWS HAS THE BEST, MOST

SCALABLE NETWORK AND HAS BY FAR
THE MOST OPERATIONALLY EXCELLENT

PLACE TO RUN LARGE WORKLOADS,
NVIDIA ACTUALLY CHOSE AWS AS THE

PLACE TO RUN THEIR OWN LARGE
SCALE GENERATIVE AI CLUSTER. AND

I'LL TELL YOU TODAY THAT WE'RE
DOUBLING DOWN ON THAT

PARTNERSHIP. SO TODAY I'M HAPPY
TO ANNOUNCE THE P6 FAMILY OF

INSTANCES.
[APPLAUSE]

P6 INSTANCES WILL FEATURE THE
NEW BLACKWELL CHIPS FROM NVIDIA,

AND THEY'LL BE COMING EARLY NEXT
YEAR. P6 INSTANCES WILL GIVE YOU

UP TO 2.5 TIMES FASTER COMPUTE
THAN THE CURRENT GENERATION OF

GPUS. THAT IS FANTASTIC. WE
EXPECT P6 TO BE INCREDIBLY

POPULAR ACROSS A BROAD RANGE OF
GENERATIVE AI APPLICATIONS, AND

SUPER EXCITED TO SEE WHAT YOU
ALL START BUILDING WITH THEM

EARLY NEXT YEAR WHEN THEY
ANNOUNCE. NOW AT AWS, HOWEVER,

WE ARE NEVER SATISFIED. AND SO
WHEN WE BUILT GRAVITON, WE SAW

THAT WE COULD BUILD A PROCESSOR
THAT WAS ACTUALLY GETTING

ADOPTED AND DELIVERING VALUE TO
CUSTOMERS. AND SO WE LOOKED AND

WE THOUGHT, WHAT ELSE COULD WE
DO? AND AS WE SAW OUT THERE IN

THE COMPUTE WORLD, WE SAW
ANOTHER TREND EMERGING, WHICH WE

JUST TALKED ABOUT, WHICH IS
ACTUALLY EVEN IN 2018, WE SAW

THAT XCELERATOR INSTANCES AND ML
DEEP LEARNING AT THE TIME WAS

GOING TO BE A BIG TREND. WE
MAYBE DIDN'T KNOW HOW BIG, BUT

WE KNEW THAT THIS WAS GOING TO
BE A BIG DEAL. AND WE SAID MAYBE

WE COULD GO IN AND THINK ABOUT
BUILDING AI CHIPS AS WELL,

BECAUSE WE THOUGHT THAT THIS WAS
GOING TO BE A BIG AREA IN THIS,

IN THIS SPACE. AND SO BUT WE
LOOKED AT IT AND THOSE CHIPS

WERE GOING TO BE MUCH MORE
COMPLICATED. WE KNEW THAT THAT

WAS GOING TO BE HARDER, BUT WE
ALSO KNEW THAT THAT WAS AN AREA

THAT WE THOUGHT WE COULD BRING
DIFFERENTIATED VALUE, MUCH LIKE

WE DID WITH GRAVITON. AND SO WE
DECIDED TO JUMP IN AND DO IT.

THE FIRST CHIP WE LAUNCHED WAS
IN 2019 WAS INFERENTIA, WHICH IS

A REALLY GOOD FIRST STEP AND
ALLOWED US TO REALLY LOWER THE

COST FOR SMALL INFERENCE
WORKLOADS IN PARTICULAR, ALEXA

WAS ONE OF OUR FIRST BIG
INFERENTIAL WORKLOADS, AND THEY

WERE ABLE TO SAVE A TON OF MONEY
MOVING TO FRIENDSHIP. THEN, IN

2022, WE LAUNCHED OUR VERY FIRST
TRAINING CHIP CALLED TRAINIUM.

ONE. NOW TRAINIUM HAD SOME
REALLY GREAT EARLY ADOPTERS.

ENTERPRISES LIKE BANCO, IBM,
RICOH AND STARTUPS LIKE NINJA

TECH AND ARCEE. AI. BUT WE KNEW
THAT THE FIRST TRAINING CHIP

WASN'T GOING TO BE PERFECT. WE
ALSO KNEW IT WASN'T GOING TO BE

A FIT FOR EVERY WORKLOAD. WE
KNEW IF A WORKLOAD COULD WORK ON

TRAINIUM ONE, WE THOUGHT THAT
CUSTOMERS COULD PROBABLY SAVE

ABOUT 50% OF THEIR WORKLOADS,
AND MANY OF THOSE EARLY ADOPTERS

DID. BUT WE ALSO KNEW THAT IT
WAS EARLY. THE SOFTWARE WAS

EARLY, AND IT WAS, AND IT WASN'T
GOING TO BE PERFECT FOR EVERY

WORKLOAD. BUT WE SAW ENOUGH
TRACTION, WE SAW ENOUGH INTEREST

FROM CUSTOMERS AND ENOUGH
SAVINGS THAT IT GAVE US

CONFIDENCE THAT WE WERE ON THE
RIGHT PATH. SO LAST YEAR AT

RE:INVENT, THIS TIME, WE
ANNOUNCED THAT WE WERE BUILDING

TRAINIUM TWO, AND TODAY I'M
EXCITED TO ANNOUNCE THE GA OF

TRAINIUM TWO POWER GCN TWO
INSTANCES.

[APPLAUSE]
NOW, TRAINIUM TWO INSTANCES ARE

OUR MOST POWERFUL INSTANCES FOR
GENERATIVE AI, ALL BECAUSE OF

THESE CUSTOM BUILT PROCESSORS
COMPLETELY BUILT IN-HOUSE BY

AWS. NOW TRAINIUM TWO DELIVERS
30 TO 40% BETTER PRICE

PERFORMANCE THAN CURRENT GPU
POWERED INSTANCES, 30 TO 40%

BETTER. THAT IS PERFORMANCE THAT
YOU CANNOT GET ANYWHERE ELSE.

TRN2 INSTANCES HAVE 16 TRAINIUM
TWO CHIPS THAT ARE ALL CONNECTED

BY A HIGH BANDWIDTH, LOW LATENCY
INTERCONNECT. WE CALL NEURAL

LINK, AND A ONE TRAINIUM TWO
INSTANCE WILL DELIVER 20.8

PETAFLOPS FROM A SINGLE COMPUTE
NODE. REALLY COOL. THESE ARE

PURPOSE BUILT FOR THE DEMANDING
WORKLOADS OF CUTTING EDGE

GENERATIVE AI TRAINING AND
INFERENCE. AGAIN, TRAINIUM TWO

INSTANCES ARE GOING TO BE
FANTASTIC FOR TRAINING AND

INFERENCE. NAMING IS NOT ALWAYS
PERFECT FOR US, BUT NOW TRAINIUM

TWO ADDS A TON OF CHOICE FOR
CUSTOMERS SO THAT THEY HAVE NOW

MORE CHOICES AS THEY THINK ABOUT
WHAT IS THE PERFECT INSTANCE FOR

THE WORKLOAD THAT THEY'RE
WORKING ON. AND EC2 HAS BY FAR

THE MOST OPPORTUNITIES FOR
DIFFERENT CHOICES. WE ACTUALLY

WORKED WITH A COUPLE OF EARLY
CUSTOMERS TO BETA TEST TRAINIUM

TWO TO MAKE SURE THAT WE WERE ON
THE RIGHT TRACK, AND WE SAW SOME

PRETTY IMPRESSIVE EARLY RESULTS.
ADOBE IS SEEING VERY PROMISING

EARLY, PROMISING EARLY TESTING
WHEN THEY STARTED RUNNING

TRAINIUM TWO AGAINST THEIR
FIREFLY INFERENCE MODEL, AND

THEY EXPECT TO SAVE SIGNIFICANT
AMOUNTS OF MONEY POOLSIDE IS A

STARTUP WHO'S BUILDING A NEXT
GENERATION SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT

PLAN, AND IS PLANNING TO TRAIN
ALL FUTURE MODELS OF THEIR LARGE

FRONTIER MODEL, ALL ON TRAINIUM
TWO. POOLSIDE EXPECTS TO SAVE

40% OVER THE ALTERNATIVE OPTIONS.
DATABRICKS IS ONE OF THE LARGEST

DATA AND AI COMPANIES ANYWHERE
IN THE WORLD, AND THEY PLAN TO

USE TRAINIUM TWO TO DELIVER
BETTER RESULTS AND LOWER THEIR

TCO FOR OUR JOINT CUSTOMERS BY
UP TO 30%. AND FINALLY, QUALCOMM

IS REALLY EXCITED ABOUT USING
TRAINIUM TWO TO DELIVER AI

SYSTEMS THAT CAN TRAIN IN THE
CLOUD AND THEN DEPLOY AT THE

EDGE. SO WE'RE VERY EXCITED
ABOUT THE EARLY RESULTS OF

TRAINIUM TWO, AND VERY EXCITED
FOR YOU ALL TO GET YOUR HANDS ON

THEM AND TRY THEM. BUT I WILL
SAY THAT WE DIDN'T STOP THERE.

AS MANY OF YOU KNOW, SOME MODELS
TODAY ARE ACTUALLY GETTING

REALLY, REALLY LARGE WITH
HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS. SOMETIMES

TRILLIONS OF PARAMETERS. AND
THOSE MODELS ARE OFTEN TOO LARGE

TO FIT ON A SINGLE SERVER. SO
I'M EXCITED TO ANNOUNCE EC2

TRAINIUM TWO ULTRA SERVERS.
[APPLAUSE]

EFFECTIVELY, AN ULTRA SERVER
CONNECTS FOR TRAINIUM TWO

INSTANCES, SO 64 TRAINIUM TWO
CHIPS ALL INTERCONNECTED BY THAT

HIGH SPEED, LOW LATENCY
NEURALINK CONNECTIVITY. WHAT

THIS DOES IS IT GIVES YOU A
SINGLE ULTRA NODE WITH OVER 83

PETAFLOPS OF COMPUTE FROM THIS
SINGLE COMPUTE NODE. THIS HAS A

MASSIVE IMPACT ON LATENCY. SO
NOW YOU CAN LOAD ONE OF THESE

REALLY LARGE MODELS ALL INTO A
SINGLE NODE. AND DELIVER MUCH

BETTER LATENCY, MUCH BETTER
PERFORMANCE FOR CUSTOMERS

WITHOUT HAVING TO BREAK IT UP
OVER MULTIPLE NODES IN ADDITION,

THIS HAS REALLY MATERIAL IMPACTS
ON TRAINING CLUSTERS. BY HAVING

THESE REALLY LARGE CLUSTERS, WE
CAN ACTUALLY BUILD MUCH, MUCH

LARGER TRAINING CLUSTERS FOR
CUSTOMERS. NOW, ONE OF THE

CUSTOMERS THAT WE'RE BUILDING, A
NEXT GENERATION FRONTIER MODEL

ON WITH TOGETHER IS ANTHROPIC.
TOGETHER WITH ANTHROPIC, AWS IS

BUILDING WHAT WE TOGETHER CALLED
PROJECT RAINIER. PROJECT RAINIER

IS GOING TO BUILD A TRUST, A
CLUSTER OF TRAINIUM TWO ULTRA

SERVERS CONTAINING HUNDREDS OF
THOUSANDS OF TRAINIUM TWO CHIPS.

NOW, THIS CLUSTER IS ACTUALLY
GOING TO BE FIVE TIMES THE

NUMBER OF EXAFLOPS AS THE
CURRENT CLUSTER THAT ANTHROPIC

USED TO TRAIN THEIR LEADING SET
OF CLAUDE MODELS THAT ARE OUT

THERE IN THE WORLD, FIVE TIMES
THE AMOUNT OF COMPUTE THAT THEY

USED FOR THE CURRENT GENERATION.
I AM SUPER EXCITED TO SEE WHAT

THE ANTHROPIC TEAM COMES UP WITH
WITH THAT SIZE CLUSTER.

[APPLAUSE]
IT'S FANTASTIC TO SEE HOW SOME

OF THE MOST INNOVATIVE COMPANIES
ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD ARE

LEANING IN AND LEANING INTO
TRAINIUM TWO FOR THEIR CUTTING

EDGE AI EFFORTS. ONE OF THE
BIGGEST, MOST INNOVATIVE

COMPANIES IN THE WORLD IS APPLE.
HERE TO TALK ABOUT HOW APPLE AND

AWS ARE WORKING TOGETHER OVER A
LONG TERM PARTNERSHIP TO

ACCELERATE THE TRAINING AND
INFERENCE THAT THEY USE TO BUILD

THEIR UNIQUE FEATURES IN FOR
THEIR CUSTOMERS IS BENOIT DUPIN,

SENIOR DIRECTOR OF MACHINE
LEARNING AND AI FROM APPLE.

WELCOME, BENOIT.
[MUSIC]

THANK YOU MATT. GOOD MORNING
EVERYONE.

[MUSIC]
I'M HAPPY TO BE BACK TODAY AS A

CUSTOMER, I SPENT MANY GREAT
YEARS AT AMAZON WHERE I GOT TO

LEAD PRODUCT SEARCH. TEN YEARS
AGO I JOINED APPLE AND I KNOW

OVERSEE OUR MACHINE LEARNING, AI
AND SEARCH INFRASTRUCTURE FOR

THE COMPANY. THIS INCLUDES OUR
PLATFORM FOR MODEL TRAINING,

FOUNDATION MODEL INFERENCE, AND
OTHER SERVICES USED ACROSS

SERIES SEARCH AND MORE. AT
APPLE, WE FOCUS ON DELIVERING

SERIES SEARCH AND MORE. AT
APPLE, WE FOCUS ON DELIVERING

INFERENCE EXPERIENCES THAT
ENRICH OUR USERS LIVES. WHAT

MAKES THIS POSSIBLE IS HARDWARE,
SOFTWARE AND SERVICES THAT COME

TOGETHER TO CREATE UNIQUE
EXPERIENCES FOR OUR USERS. MANY

OF THESE EXPERIENCES COME AS
PART OF THE DEVICE WE MAKE, AND

SOME RUN IN THE CLOUD LIKE
ICLOUD MUSIC, APPLE TV NEWS, APP

STORE, SIRI, AND MANY MORE. ONE
OF THE UNIQUE ELEMENTS ABOUT

APPLE BUSINESS IS THE SCALE AT
WHICH WE OPERATE, AND THE SPEED

WITH WHICH WE INNOVATE. AWS HAS
BEEN ABLE TO KEEP THE PACE, AND

WE HAVE BEEN CUSTOMERS FOR MORE
THAN A DECADE. THEY CONSISTENTLY

SUPPORT OUR DYNAMIC NEEDS AT
SCALE AND GLOBALLY. AS WE HAVE

GROWN OUR EFFORTS AROUND MACHINE
LEARNING AND AI, OUR USE OF AWS

HAS GROWN RIGHT ALONGSIDE. WE
APPRECIATE WORKING WITH AWS. WE

HAVE A STRONG RELATIONSHIP AND
THE INFRASTRUCTURE IS BOTH

RELIABLE, PERFORMANT AND ABLE TO
SERVE OUR CUSTOMERS WORLDWIDE.

AND THERE ARE SO MANY SERVICES
WE RELY ON, WE COULD NOT EVEN

FIT THEM ALL ON THIS TINY SCREEN.
AS AN EXAMPLE, WHEN WE NEEDED TO

SCALE INFERENCE GLOBALLY FOR
SEARCH, WE DID SO BY LEVERAGING

AWS SERVICES IN MORE THAN TEN
REGIONS, MORE RECENTLY, WE HAVE

STARTED TO USE AWS SOLUTIONS
WITH GRAVITON AND INFERENTIA FOR

ML SERVICES LIKE APPROXIMATE
NEAREST NEIGHBOR SEARCH AND OUR

KEY VALUE STREAMING STORE. WE
HAVE REALIZED OVER 40%

EFFICIENCY GAINS BY MIGRATING
OUR AWS INSTANCES FROM X86 TO

GRAVITON, AND WE HAVE BEEN ABLE
TO EXECUTE SOME OF OUR SEARCH

TEXT FEATURES TWICE AS
EFFICIENTLY. AFTER MOVING FROM

G4 INSTANCES TO INFERENTIA TWO.
THIS YEAR HAS MARKED ONE OF OUR

MOST AMBITIOUS YEARS FOR MACHINE
LEARNING AND AI TO DATE, AS WE

HAVE BUILT AND LAUNCHED APPLE
INTELLIGENCE, APPLE INTELLIGENCE

IS PERSONAL INTELLIGENCE. IT'S
AN INCREDIBLE SET OF FEATURES

INTEGRATED ACROSS IPHONE, IPAD
AND MAC THAT UNDERSTAND YOU AND

HELP YOU WORK, COMMUNICATE, AND
EXPRESS YOURSELF. APPLE

INTELLIGENCE IS POWERED BY OUR
OWN LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS.

DIFFUSION MODELS, AND ADAPTS ON
DEVICE AND SERVERS. FEATURES

INCLUDE OUR SYSTEM WIDE WRITING
TOOLS, NOTIFICATION SUMMARIES,

IMPROVEMENT TO SIRI, AND MORE,
INCLUDING MY FAVORITE GENMOJI'S.

AND THESE ALL RUN IN A WAY THAT
PROTECTS USER'S PRIVACY AT EVERY

STEPS TO DEVELOP. APPLE
INTELLIGENCE, WE NEEDED TO

FURTHER SCALE OUR INFRASTRUCTURE
FOR TRAINING TO SUPPORT THIS

INNOVATION, WE NEEDED ACCESS TO
A LARGE AMOUNT OF THE MOST

PERFORMANT ACCELERATORS. AND
AGAIN, AWS HAS BEEN RIGHT THERE

ALONGSIDE US AS WE'VE SCALED. WE
WORK WITH AWS SERVICES ACROSS

VIRTUALLY ALL PHASES OF OUR AI
AND ML LIFECYCLE. KEY AREAS

WHERE WE LEVERAGE AWS INCLUDE
FINE TUNING OUR MODELS. THE

POST-TRAINING OPTIMIZATION WHERE
WE DISTILL OUR MODELS TO FIT ON

DEVICE, AND BUILDING AND
FINALIZING OUR APPLE

INTELLIGENCE ADAPTERS. READY TO
DEPLOY ON APPLE DEVICES AND

SERVERS. AS WE CONTINUE TO
EXPAND THE CAPABILITIES AND

FEATURES OF APPLE INTELLIGENCE,
WE WILL CONTINUE TO DEPEND ON

THE SCALABLE, EFFICIENT, AND
HIGH PERFORMING XCELERATOR

TECHNOLOGIES THAT AWS DELIVERS.
LIKE MATT MENTIONED, TRAINIUM

TWO IS JUST BECOMING GA. WE'RE
IN THE EARLY STAGES OF

EVALUATING TRAINIUM TWO, AND WE
EXPECT FROM EARLY NUMBERS TO

GAIN UP TO 50% IMPROVEMENT IN
EFFICIENCY IN PRE-TRAINING. WITH

AWS, WE FOUND THAT WORKING
CLOSELY TOGETHER AND TAKING

ADVANTAGE OF THE LATEST
TECHNOLOGIES HAS HELPED US BE

MORE EFFICIENT IN THE CLOUD. AWS
EXPERTISE, GUIDANCE AND SERVICES

HAVE BEEN INSTRUMENTAL IN
SUPPORTING OUR SCALE AND GROWTH

AND MOST IMPORTANTLY, IN
DELIVERING INCREDIBLE

EXPERIENCES FOR OUR USERS. THANK
YOU SO MUCH.

[APPLAUSE]
[MUSIC]

ALL RIGHT. THANKS A LOT, BENOIT.
WE REALLY APPRECIATE THE

LONGTIME PARTNERSHIP TOGETHER
AND WE'RE EXCITED ABOUT ALL OF

THOSE SUPER USEFUL FEATURES THAT
YOU'RE DELIVERING THAT WE CAN

ALL TAKE ADVANTAGE OF, CAN'T WAIT TO SEE WHAT

YOU COME UP WITH. AND USING
TRAINIUM TWO. ALL RIGHT, NOW,

WHILE WE'RE REALLY EXCITED AS
YOU CAN TELL BY ANNOUNCING THE

GA OF TRAINIUM TWO TODAY, IT
TURNS OUT THAT THE GENERATIVE AI

SPACE IS MOVING AT LIGHTNING
SPEED. AND SO WE'RE NOT SLOWING

DOWN EITHER. WE ARE COMMITTED TO
DELIVERING ON THE VISION OF

TRAINIUM LONG TERM. WE KNOW THAT
WE HAVE TO KEEP UP WITH THE

EVOLVING NEEDS OF GENERATIVE AI
AND THE ENTIRE LANDSCAPE THAT

YOU ALL NEED FROM US AND YOUR
INSTANCES, WHICH IS WHY TODAY

I'M EXCITED TO ALSO ANNOUNCE THE
NEXT LEAP FORWARD. TODAY WE'RE

ANNOUNCING TRAINIUM THREE,
COMING LATER NEXT YEAR.

[APPLAUSE]
TRAINIUM THREE WILL BE OUR FIRST

CHIP THAT AWS MAKES ON THE THREE
NANOMETER PROCESS, AND IT'LL

GIVE YOU TWO X MORE COMPUTE THAN
YOU GET FROM TRAINIUM TWO. IT'LL

ALSO BE 40% MORE EFFICIENT,
WHICH IS GREAT AS WELL. SO IT'LL

ALLOW YOU ALL TO BUILD BIGGER,
FASTER, MORE EXCITING GEN AI

APPLICATIONS. MORE INSTANCES,
MORE CAPABILITIES. MORE. MORE

COMPUTE THAN ANY OTHER CLOUD OF
SILICON INNOVATIONS AND NITRO

AND GRAVITON AND TRAINIUM. WE
HAVE HIGH PERFORMANCE NETWORKING

TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU CAN REALLY
THE NETWORK DOESN'T GET IN YOUR

WAY. AND THIS IS ALL WHY ON
AVERAGE, EVERY SINGLE DAY, 130

MILLION NEW EC2 INSTANCES ARE
LAUNCHED EVERY DAY. PRETTY

INCREDIBLE. NOW, EVERY DAY WE
CONTINUE TO RE:INVENT WHAT

COMPUTE MEANS IN THE CLOUD. BUT
OF COURSE, YOUR APPLICATIONS

DON'T STOP WITH COMPUTE. SO
LET'S MOVE ON TO OUR NEXT

BUILDING BLOCK. AND THAT'S
STORAGE. NOW, IF EVERY

APPLICATION NEEDS COMPUTE
BECAUSE IT PROVIDES ALL THAT

PROCESSING POWER OF COURSE EVERY
APPLICATION ALSO NEEDS STORAGE

BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE YOUR DATA
LIVES. NOW, I KNOW IT'S A LONG

TIME AGO, BUT SOME OF YOU MAY
ACTUALLY REMEMBER WHAT STORAGE

USED TO BE LIKE BEFORE AWS. YOU
WOULD BE YOU WOULD HAVE A ROOM

AND YOU JUST HAVE ALL THESE
BOXES, STORAGE BOXES, AND YOU'D

FILL UP A BOX AND YOU'D HAVE TO
HAVE ANOTHER ONE, AND THEN YOU'D

HAVE TO HAVE ANOTHER ONE. THEN
YOU'D HAVE TO GO BACK TO THE

FIRST ONE, BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO
REPLACE SOME DISKS, AND IT WAS

REALLY HARD TO MANAGE. AND IN
TODAY'S WORLD IT WOULD ACTUALLY

BE ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO KEEP UP
WITH THE SCALE THAT YOU ALL HAVE

OF YOUR DATA IN. BACK IN 2006,
WE ENVISIONED A BETTER WAY WE

COULD JUST PROVIDE SIMPLE,
DURABLE, HIGHLY SCALABLE, SECURE

STORAGE THAT VIRTUALLY COULD
SCALE WITH ANY APPLICATION. AND

SO WE LAUNCHED S3. IT'S OUR VERY
FIRST SERVICE THAT WE LAUNCHED

IN 2006, AND IT FUNDAMENTALLY
CHANGED HOW PEOPLE MANAGE DATA

BUILT FROM THE GROUND UP TO
HANDLE EXPLOSIVE GROWTH OVER THE

LAST 18 YEARS. S3 NOW STORES
OVER 400 TRILLION OBJECTS. THAT

IS JUST INCREDIBLE. IT'S REALLY
HARD TO GET YOUR HEAD AROUND

WHAT THAT IS. HERE'S ONE
INTERESTING THING. TEN YEARS

AGO, WE HAD FEWER THAN 100
CUSTOMERS THAT STORED A PETABYTE,

A PETABYTES, A LOT OF STORAGE.
WE HAD FEWER THAN 100 CUSTOMERS

THAT STORED A PETABYTE OF
STORAGE INSIDE OF S3. TODAY WE

HAVE THOUSANDS OF CUSTOMERS, ALL
STORING MORE THAN A PETABYTE AND

SEVERAL CUSTOMERS THAT ARE
STORING MORE THAN AN EXABYTE.

AND THIS SCALING IS SOMETHING
THAT CUSTOMERS TODAY JUST TAKE

FOR GRANTED. IT'S NOT JUST
SCALING THOUGH. 

DATA TODAY IS JUST
EXPLODING. AND THE SCALING PART

YOU LARGELY ASSUME S3 TAKES CARE
OF IT FOR YOU. THE NEXT THING

HOWEVER MANY OF YOU DO HAVE TO
WORRY ABOUT IS COST. BUT IT

TURNS OUT WE MAKE THAT EASIER
FOR YOU TO. NO ONE GIVES YOU

MORE OPTIONS TO BALANCE THE
PERFORMANCE YOU NEED FROM YOUR

STORAGE. TOGETHER WITH THE COST.
WE HAVE A TON OF SKUS TO HELP

YOU WITH THIS. THINGS LIKE S3
STANDARD, WHICH IS HIGHLY

DURABLE, AND IT'S GOOD FOR THE
MAJORITY OF WORKLOADS THAT YOU

REGULARLY ACCESS. BUT WHEN YOU
HAVE OBJECTS THAT YOU DON'T

ACCESS THAT FREQUENTLY, WE HAVE
S3 INFREQUENT ACCESS THAT ALLOWS

YOU TO LOWER YOUR COSTS. WE HAVE
THINGS LIKE S3 GLACIER, WHICH

CAN FURTHER REDUCE COSTS BY UP
TO 95% FOR OBJECTS LIKE BACKUP

AND ARCHIVE THAT YOU DON'T NEED
TO ACCESS VERY MUCH AT ALL. NOW,

CUSTOMERS HAVE TOLD US THAT THEY
LOVE HAVING ALL OF THESE

DIFFERENT SKUS AND ALL OF THESE
DIFFERENT STOPS THAT HELP THEM

BALANCE COST AND PERFORMANCE,
BUT IT'S ALSO A LOT OF WORK CAN

MAKE IT COMPLEX TO FIGURE OUT IF
YOU SHOULD USE THIS SKEW OR THIS

SKEW. AND SO WE DECIDED TO MAKE
THAT EASIER. A COUPLE YEARS AGO

WE LAUNCHED S3
INTELLIGENT-TIERING. WHAT S3

INTELLIGENT-TIERING DOES IS IT
ANALYZES THE ACCESS PATTERNS FOR

YOUR STORAGE, AND IT
AUTOMATICALLY MOVES YOUR DATA TO

THE RIGHT TIER. SINCE WE
LAUNCHED S3 INTELLIGENT-TIERING

WITHOUT HAVING TO DO ANYTHING,
CUSTOMERS HAVE SAVED OVER $4

BILLION WITH ZERO ADDITIONAL
WORK ON YOUR PART. IT'S PRETTY

AWESOME. AND WHAT'S REALLY
POWERFUL, RIGHT, IS WHEN YOU

CAN. AND THAT IS IT'S AN
INTERESTING OBSERVATION. IT'S

SUPER POWERFUL WHEN YOU CAN
COMPLETELY ELIMINATE ALL OF THAT

COMPLEXITY AND JUST FOCUS ON
GROWING YOUR BUSINESS. AND SO

THEN WHEN YOU'RE MANAGING
GIGABYTES OF DATA OR PETABYTES

OF DATA OR EVEN EXABYTES OF
DATA, S3 CAN HANDLE IT FOR YOU.

AND PART OF THAT BENEFITS OF
THAT SCALE, THE PERFORMANCE THAT

COST AND EASE OF USE AND
ADVANCED CAPABILITIES IS WHY S3

IS UNDERLYING MORE THAN A
MILLION DATA LAKES ALL AROUND

THE WORLD. NOW. DATA DATA LAKES
SUPPORT LARGE ANALYTICS

WORKLOADS. THINGS LIKE FINANCIAL
MODELING, THINGS LIKE REAL TIME

ADVERTISING AND AI WORKLOADS AND
S3 OVER THE YEARS HAS DELIVERED

A NUMBER OF DATA. LAKE
INNOVATIONS. THEY'VE GIVEN

TRANSLATE TRANSACTIONS PER
SECOND INCREASES SO YOU CAN

SUPPORT FASTER ANALYTICS. THEY
ADDED SUPPORT FOR STRONG

CONSISTENCY. THEY ADDED LOWER
LATENCY SKUS SO THAT YOU COULD

GET QUICKER ACCESS IN THE CLOUD.
AND OFTENTIMES WHEN I TALK TO

CUSTOMERS, IT'S FUNNY. YOU'LL
SAY, WHAT IS IT THAT YOU LIKE

BEST ABOUT S3? AND WHAT THEY'LL
TELL ME IS, YOU KNOW WHAT I LIKE

BEST ABOUT S3? S3 JUST WORKS.
AND THAT IS WHY WE TAKE THAT AS

QUITE A COMPLIMENT. BUT AS YOU
KNOW, AWS IS NEVER SATISFIED.

AND SO THE S3 TEAM STEPPED BACK
AND SAID, HOW CAN WE MAKE S3

WORK BETTER? AND SO THEY THOUGHT
ABOUT HOW CAN WE MAKE S3

IMPROVED FOR SUPPORTING LARGE
ANALYTICS AND AI USE CASES. AND

FIRST, ACTUALLY, LET'S TAKE A
STEP BACK AND UNDERSTAND A

LITTLE BIT ABOUT HOW YOU THINK
ABOUT YOUR ANALYTICS DATA. IT'S

FIRST HELPED TO UNDERSTAND HOW
IT'S ORGANIZED. SO MOST

ANALYTICS DATA IS ACTUALLY
ORGANIZED IN TABULAR FORM OKAY.

IT'S A HIGHLY EFFICIENT WAY TO
WORK WITH A LOT OF DIFFERENT

DATA THAT YOU WANT TO QUERY. AND
APACHE PARQUET HAS EFFECTIVELY

BECOME THE DE FACTO OPEN
STANDARD FOR HOW YOU STORE

TABULAR DATA IN THE CLOUD. AND
MOST OF THAT IS STORED IN S3. IN

FACT, BECAUSE IT'S SUCH A GOOD
FIT FOR DATA LAKES, PARQUET IS

ACTUALLY ONE OF THE FASTEST
GROWING DATA LAKE OR DATA TYPES

IN ALL OF S3. NOW, WHEN YOU HAVE
A BUNCH OF THESE PARQUET FILES

AND MANY CUSTOMERS HAVE
MILLIONS, ACTUALLY SOME

CUSTOMERS IN AWS HAVE BILLIONS
OF PARQUET FILES THAT THEY

STORE. YOU WANT TO DO THINGS
LIKE QUERY ACROSS THEM, AND SO

YOU NEED A FILE STRUCTURE TO
SUPPORT THAT. AND TODAY MOST

PEOPLE USE APACHE ICEBERG TO
SUPPORT THIS. ICEBERG IS A AS

MANY OF YOU ALL KNOW, IS AN OPEN
SOURCE, HIGHLY PERFORMANT FORMAT

THAT ALLOWS YOU TO WORK ACROSS
ALL OF THESE VARIOUS FILE

FORMATS AND PARQUET FILES THAT
YOU HAVE AND ENABLES SOME REALLY

USEFUL THINGS. IT ENABLES SQL
ACCESS ACROSS THIS BROAD DATA

LAKE, SO YOU CAN HAVE DIFFERENT
PEOPLE IN YOUR ORGANIZATION

USING VARIOUS DIFFERENT
ANALYTICS TOOLS. MAYBE THEY'RE

USING SPARK OR FLINK OR
WHATEVER, AND THEY CAN ALL

SAFELY WORK ON THE DATA WITHOUT
HAVING TO WORRY ABOUT MESSING UP

EACH OTHER'S WORKLOADS. ICEBERG
IS A SUPER USEFUL OPEN SOURCE

CONSTRUCT FOR THIS, AND BUT IT
ENABLES A LOT OF THESE

CAPABILITIES. A LOT OF CUSTOMERS
WILL TELL YOU THAT AS MANY OPEN

SOURCE PROJECTS ARE. ICEBERG IS
ACTUALLY REALLY CHALLENGING TO

MANAGE, PARTICULARLY AT SCALE.
IT'S HARD TO MANAGE THE

PERFORMANCE. IT'S HARD TO MANAGE
THE SCALABILITY. IT'S HARD TO

MANAGE THE SECURITY. AND SO WHAT
HAPPENS IS MOST OF YOU ALL OUT

THERE HIRE DEDICATED TEAMS TO DO
THIS. YOU DO THINGS TO TAKE CARE

OF THINGS LIKE TABLE
MAINTENANCE. YOU YOU WORRY ABOUT

DATA COMPACTION. YOU WORRY ABOUT
ACCESS CONTROLS. ALL OF THESE

THINGS THAT MANAGE THAT. YOU GO
INTO MANAGING AND TRYING TO GET

BETTER PERFORMANCE OUT OF YOUR
ICEBERG IMPLEMENTATIONS. SO WE

ASKED THE QUESTION, WHAT IF S3
COULD JUST DO THIS FOR YOU? WHAT

IF WE COULD JUST DO IT
AUTOMATICALLY? WELL, I AM

THRILLED TO ANNOUNCE THE LAUNCH
OF A NEW S3 TYPE S3 TABLE

BUCKETS.
[APPLAUSE]

AND S3 TABLE BUCKETS. THIS IS S3
TABLES. IT'S A NEW BUCKET TYPE

SPECIFICALLY FOR ICEBERG TABLES.
AND WHAT THIS DOES IS WE

BASICALLY IMPROVE THE
PERFORMANCE AND SCALABILITY OF

ALL OF YOUR ICEBERG TABLES. IF
YOU STORE ALL YOUR PARQUET FILES

INTO AN ICEBERG, INTO ONE OF
THESE S3 TABLE BUCKETS, YOU GET

THREE X BETTER QUERY
PERFORMANCE. YOU GET TEN TIMES

HIGHER TRANSACTIONS PER SECOND
COMPARED TO STORING THESE

ICEBERG TABLES IN A GENERAL
PURPOSE S3 BUCKET THAT IS

MASSIVE PERFORMANCE FOR REALLY
DOING NO ADDITIONAL WORK. NOW

HOW THIS WORKS IS S3. DOES THIS
WORK FOR YOU? YOU PUT IT HERE

AND WE'LL AUTOMATICALLY HANDLE
ALL THE TABLE MAINTENANCE

EVENTS, THINGS LIKE COMPACTION,
THINGS LIKE SNAPSHOT MANAGEMENT,

ALL OF THAT UNDIFFERENTIATED
THINGS. WE'LL REMOVE

UNREFERENCED FILES TO HELP
MANAGE THE SIZE AND ALL OF THOSE

THINGS ARE GOING TO BE
CONTINUALLY OPTIMIZED. WE'RE

CONTINUALLY OPTIMIZED THAT QUERY
PERFORMANCE FOR YOU AND THE COST

AS YOUR DATA LAKE SCALES. SO
IT'S PRETTY LIKE THIS IS A

FANTASTIC THING WHERE S3 IS
COMPLETELY REINVENTING OBJECT

STORAGE. SPECIFICALLY FOR THE
DATA LAKE WORLD TO DELIVER

BETTER PERFORMANCE, BETTER COST,
AND BETTER SCALE. I THINK THIS

IS A GAME CHANGER FOR DATA LAKE
PERFORMANCE, BUT PERFORMANCE IS

ACTUALLY ONLY A SMALL PART OF
THE EQUATION. YOU ALL KNOW AS

YOUR DATA VOLUME SCALES, IT
ACTUALLY GETS HARDER AND HARDER

TO FIND THE DATA YOU'RE LOOKING
FOR. AND SO AS YOU GET REALLY

LARGE, AS YOU GET PETABYTES OF
DATA, METADATA BECOMES REALLY

IMPORTANT. METADATA IS THIS
INFORMATION THAT HELPS YOU

ORGANIZE AND UNDERSTAND
INFORMATION ABOUT THE OBJECTS

THAT YOU STORE IN S3. SO YOU CAN
REALLY FIND WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING

FOR, WHETHER YOU HAVE PETABYTES
OR EXABYTES OF DATA. THAT

METADATA HELPS, BUT YOU HAVE TO
HAVE A WAY TO LOOK AT IT. I'LL

JUST USE AN EXAMPLE OF WHY
METADATA IS USEFUL ON MY PHONE.

I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU ALL. I
HAVE TONS OF PHOTOS AND SO I

ACTUALLY WENT AND SAID I WANT TO
FIND AN OLD PHOTO OF ME FROM AN

OLD RE:INVENT SO IT WASN'T THAT
HARD. I ACTUALLY SEARCHED FOR

LAS VEGAS. I SEARCHED FOR 2001
AND I QUICKLY FOUND THIS. NOW

THIS IS A PICTURE OF ME AND DON
MACASKILL, WHO'S SITTING RIGHT

HERE IN THE FRONT ROW, CEO OF
SMUGMUG. AND DON WAS ACTUALLY

OUR VERY FIRST S3 CUSTOMER BACK
IN 2006. THANK YOU. DON.

[APPLAUSE]
NOW, HOW DID I QUICKLY FIND THIS

PHOTO? I DON'T KNOW, MY PHONE
JUST AUTOMATICALLY ADDED

METADATA, RIGHT? IT ADDED THE
LOCATION. IT ADDED THE DATES OF

THE PHOTO WHEN IT WAS STORED,
AND SO IT WAS EASY FOR ME TO

SEARCH IT. YOU NEED A WAY TO
FIND THIS DATA EASILY, BUT WHEN

YOU'RE DOING IT IN S3 TODAY,
IT'S ACTUALLY REALLY HARD. YOU

HAVE TO BUILD A METADATA SYSTEM
WHERE YOU HAVE TO BUILD, FIRST

OF ALL, ALL, A LIST OF ALL OF
YOUR OBJECTS THAT ARE IN

STORAGE, AND THEN YOU CREATE AND
MANAGE THIS EVENT PROCESSING

PIPELINE, BECAUSE YOU'RE GOING
TO HAVE TO FIGURE OUT HOW YOU

ADD METADATA AND ASSOCIATE IT
WITH ALL YOUR S3 OBJECTS. RIGHT.

AND SO YOU BASICALLY BUILD THESE
EVENT PROCESSING PIPELINES THAT

DO THIS. YOU STORE THE METADATA
IN SOME SORT OF DATABASE THAT

YOU CAN QUERY, AND THEN YOU
DEVELOP CODE TO KEEP THESE

THINGS IN SYNC. SO AS OBJECTS
CHANGE OR ADDED OR DELETED, YOU

KEEP THE METADATA UP IN SYNC TO
THAT. NOW AT SCALE, YOU CAN

IMAGINE FIRST OF ALL, THIS IS
UNDIFFERENTIATED HEAVY LIFTING,

AND IT'S PRETTY TO IMPOSSIBLE
MANAGE AT SCALE. NOW THERE'S A

BETTER WAY. I'M EXCITED TO
ANNOUNCE S3 METADATA.

[APPLAUSE]
S3 METADATA IS THE FASTEST AND

EASIEST WAY FOR YOU TO INSTANTLY
DISCOVER INFORMATION ABOUT YOUR

S3 DATA, SO THIS JUST MAKES
SENSE. WHAT WE DO IS WE TAKE

WHEN YOU HAVE AN OBJECT, WE TAKE
THE METADATA THAT'S ASSOCIATED

WITH YOUR FILE, AND WE MAKE THIS
EASILY QUERYABLE METADATA THAT

UPDATES IN REAL, NEAR REAL TIME.
HOW DOES IT WORK? WE TAKE ALL OF

YOUR OBJECT METADATA AND STORE
IT IN ONE OF THESE NEW TABLE

BUCKETS THAT WE TALKED ABOUT. SO
WE AUTOMATICALLY STORE ALL OF

YOUR OBJECT METADATA IN AN
ICEBERG TABLE. AND THEN YOU CAN

USE YOUR FAVORITE ANALYTICS TOOL
TO EASILY INTERACT AND QUERY

THAT DATA. SO YOU CAN QUICKLY
LEARN MORE ABOUT YOUR OBJECTS

AND FIND THE OBJECT YOU'RE
LOOKING FOR. AND AS OBJECTS

CHANGE, S3 AUTOMATICALLY
ACTUALLY UPDATES THE METADATA

FOR YOU IN MINUTES. SO IT'S
ALWAYS UP TO DATE. WE THINK

CUSTOMERS ARE JUST GOING TO LOVE
THIS CAPABILITY, AND IT'S REALLY

A STEP CHANGE IN HOW YOU CAN USE
YOUR S3 DATA. WE THINK THAT THIS

MATERIALLY CHANGES HOW YOU CAN
USE YOUR DATA FOR ANALYTICS, AS

WELL AS REALLY LARGE AI MODELING
USE CASES. SUPER EXCITED ABOUT

THESE NEW S3 FEATURES NOW. FROM
DAY ONE, WE'VE BEEN PUSHING THE

BOUNDARIES OF WHAT'S POSSIBLE
WITH CLOUD STORAGE. WE'VE HELPED

MANY OF YOU GROW TO JUST
UNPRECEDENTED SCALE. WE'VE

HELPED YOU TO OPTIMIZE YOUR
COST, AND WE'VE HELPED YOU TO

GET UNMATCHED PERFORMANCE. AND
NOW WE MAKE IT INCREDIBLY EASY

FOR YOU TO FIND THE DATA THAT
YOU'RE LOOKING FOR. BUT I WILL

TELL YOU, WE'RE NEVER DONE. OUR
PROMISE TO YOU IS THAT WE WILL

KEEP AUTOMATING WORK. WE'LL KEEP
SIMPLIFYING ALL OF THESE COMPLEX

PROCESSES THAT YOU HAVE, AND
WE'LL KEEP REINVENTING STORAGE

SO YOU ALL CAN FOCUS ON
INNOVATING FOR YOUR CUSTOMERS.

NOW LET'S HEAR FROM ANOTHER
STARTUP CUSTOMER TO SEE HOW

THEY'RE REINVENTING THEIR OWN
INDUSTRY.

[MUSIC]
IN 1995, THE WAY YOU EXISTED

DIGITALLY WAS TO HAVE A WEBSITE.
IN 2015, IT WAS TO HAVE A MOBILE

APP YOU COULD INSTALL ON YOUR
PHONE IN 2025. THE WAY YOU'RE IN

EXIST DIGITALLY IS TO HAVE AN AI
AGENT. WE MOVED FROM AN ERA OF

RULE BASED SOFTWARE TO AN ERA OF
SOFTWARE BUILT ON GOALS AND

GUARDRAILS. WE'RE IN THE AGE OF
CONVERSATIONAL AI, AND THE WAY

YOU EXIST DIGITALLY IS TO HAVE A
CONVERSATION WITH YOUR CUSTOMER

ANY TIME OF DAY 24 OVER SEVEN,
AND THAT'S WHAT WE'VE BUILT WITH

SIERRA ON AMAZON WEB SERVICES.
[MUSIC]

OLD SOFTWARE WAS BASED ON RULES.
IF YOU THINK ABOUT A TYPICAL

WORKFLOW AUTOMATION, IT LOOKED
LIKE A DECISION TREE. YOU HAD TO

ENUMERATE EVERY POSSIBILITY THAT
YOUR CUSTOMERS COULD DO. WITH

AI. IT'S DIFFERENT, AND WITH
AGENT OS, YOU CAN MODEL YOUR

COMPANY'S GOALS AND GUARDRAILS
TO BUILD ANY CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE

THAT YOU CAN IMAGINE. WHAT DOES
IT MEAN IF 90% OF YOUR CUSTOMER

EXPERIENCE IS CONVERSATIONAL?
[MUSIC]

IT'S REMARKABLE HOW EASY IT IS
TO START A COMPANY THANKS TO

SERVICES LIKE AMAZON WEB
SERVICES, WE CAN FOCUS ON WHERE

WE WANT TO ADD VALUE AND REALLY
RIDING THE COATTAILS OF THE

INCREDIBLE INVESTMENT THAT
AMAZON HAS MADE INTO THEIR CLOUD

INFRASTRUCTURE.
[MUSIC]

I THINK THE COMPANIES THAT HAVE
RUN SUCCESSFUL EXPERIMENTS TODAY

WILL BE THE ONES THAT, FIVE
YEARS FROM NOW, HAVE BUSINESS

TRANSFORMATION DRIVEN BY AI. I
THINK THE WAY TO DEAL WITH

TECHNOLOGIES LIKE THAT IS TO
DIVE IN AND LEARN AS QUICKLY AS

POSSIBLE.
[MUSIC]

[APPLAUSE]
VERY COOL. THANKS, BRETT. I

THINK CUSTOMERS ARE REALLY GOING
TO LOVE THAT. ALL RIGHT. I WANT

TO SHIFT OUR FOCUS TO ANOTHER
IMPORTANT BUILDING BLOCK

DATABASES. NOW, EARLY ON IN AWS,
WE SAW AN OPPORTUNITY TO REALLY

IMPROVE HOW DATABASES OPERATED.
IT TURNS OUT DATABASES WERE

SUPER COMPLICATED, AND THERE WAS
A TON OF OVERHEAD IN MANAGING

THEM. AND CUSTOMERS SPENT A LOT
OF TIME DOING THINGS LIKE

PATCHING AND MANAGING. AND WE
KNEW THAT THERE WAS A LOT THAT

WE COULD TAKE ON FOR THEM. SO WE
SET OFF TO REMOVE THIS

HEAVY LIFTING. RIGHT. WE
LAUNCHED RDS, THE FIRST FULLY

MANAGED RELATIONAL DATABASE
SERVICE. AND WHEN YOU TALK TO

CUSTOMERS TODAY, THEY'LL TELL
YOU THEY ARE NEVER GOING BACK TO

AN UNMANAGED DATABASE SERVICE.
THEY LOVE MANAGED DATABASES. NOW

WHEN WE FIRST LAUNCHED RDS, THE
VAST MAJORITY OF APPLICATIONS

OUT THERE IN THE WORLD WERE
RUNNING ON RELATIONAL DATABASES,

BUT IT TURNS OUT THE NATURE OF
APPLICATIONS WAS EVOLVING. A

BIT. AND WITH THE INTERNET
APPLICATIONS STARTED TO HAVE

MORE USERS RIGHT. THEY WERE
INCREASINGLY DISTRIBUTED ALL

AROUND THE WORLD, AND CUSTOMERS
HAVE STARTED TO HAVE VERY

DIFFERENT EXPECTATIONS AROUND
PERFORMANCE AND LATENCY. WE

OURSELVES EXPERIENCED THIS AT
AMAZON.COM IN OUR RETAIL SITE.

SO BACK IN 2004, WE HAD A COUPLE
ENGINEERS WHO REALIZED THAT OVER

70% OF OUR DATABASE OPERATIONS
WERE JUST SIMPLE KEY VALUE

TRANSACTIONS, MEANING WE'D RUN A
SIMPLE SQL QUERY AND YOU'D GET

THE PRIMARY WITH THE PRIMARY
KEY, AND YOU'D GET A SINGLE

VALUE BACK. AND WE ASKED
OURSELVES WHY ARE WE USING A

RELATIONAL DATABASE FOR THIS? IT
SEEMS OVERWEIGHT AND THE THOUGHT

OF THE TEAM AT THE TIME WAS
MAYBE IT WOULD PERFORM LIKE WE

COULD MAKE THIS FASTER. WE COULD
MAKE IT CHEAPER, AND WE COULD

MAKE IT SCALE BETTER. IF WE
COULD BUILD A PURPOSE BUILT

DATABASE. SO THOSE ENGINEERS,
TWO OF YOU WHOM YOU SEE UP HERE,

ARE OUR VERY OWN SWAMI AND
WERNER, WHO ARE BEGINNING

KEYNOTES LATER THIS WEEK, WROTE
WHAT IS NOW CALLED THE DYNAMO

PAPER ABOUT A TECHNOLOGY THAT
SPANS THAT REALLY SPAWNS THE

NOSQL MOVEMENT. AND IT ALSO LED
US TO DEVELOP DYNAMODB. DYNAMO

IS A SERVERLESS, NOSQL, FULLY
MANAGED DATABASE THAT GIVES YOU

SINGLE MILLISECOND LATENCY
PERFORMANCE AT ANY SCALE, SCALES

COMPLETELY UP AND ALL THE WAY
DOWN. BUT DYNAMO IS JUST THE

FIRST PURPOSE BUILT DATABASE
THAT WE BUILT. WE GOT REALLY

EXCITED ABOUT THAT, AND WE
STARTED BUILDING LOTS OF PURPOSE

BUILT DATABASES FROM GRAPH
DATABASES TO TIME SERIES

DATABASES TO DOCUMENT DATABASES.
AND THE IDEA HERE WAS YOU ALL

NEEDED THE BEST TOOL FOR THE
BEST JOB. AND THAT'S WHAT THESE

DATABASES ALL PROVIDED. NOW,
THESE NOSQL DATABASES IN THIS

WIDE SWATH OF PURPOSE BUILT
DATABASES HAVE BEEN INCREDIBLY

POPULAR. THEY HAVE ENABLED
WORKLOADS THAT OTHERWISE JUST

WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE. AND
YOU ALL HAVE LOVED THEM. BUT IT

TURNS OUT THAT SOMETIMES THE
BEST DATABASE FOR THE JOB IS

STILL RELATIONAL. AND SO
RELATIONAL DIDN'T GO AWAY. IT'S

STILL BY FAR THE BEST SOLUTION
FOR MANY APPLICATIONS. SO WE

KEPT INNOVATING THERE AS WELL.
YOU ASKED US TO BUILD YOUR

RELATIONAL DATABASE WITH THE
RELIABILITY OF COMMERCIAL

DATABASES OUT THERE, BUT WITH
FRIENDLIER LICENSING TERMS AND

THE PORTABILITY OF OPEN SOURCE.
AND SO WE'RE ACTUALLY

CELEBRATING THE TEN YEAR
ANNIVERSARY OF LAUNCHING AURORA

AT RE:INVENT, CELEBRATING TEN
YEARS.

[APPLAUSE]
OF AURORA IS, OF COURSE, FULLY

MYSQL AND POSTGRES COMPATIBLE,
AND IT DELIVERS 3 TO 5 X. THE

PERFORMANCE THAT YOU GET FROM
SELF-MANAGED OPEN SOURCE, ALL AT

ONE TENTH THE COST OF COMMERCIAL
DATABASES. IT'S NO SURPRISE,

REALLY, THAT AURORA BECAME OUR
FASTEST GROWING, MOST POPULAR

SERVICE WITH HUNDREDS OF
THOUSANDS OF CUSTOMERS. BUT WE

DIDN'T STOP INNOVATING, OF
COURSE. AND HERE'S JUST A SAMPLE

OF THE INNOVATIONS THAT WE'VE
DELIVERED IN AURORA OVER THE

YEARS. WE DELIVERED SERVERLESS
SO YOU COULD GET RID OF MANAGING

CAPACITY. WE DELIVERED I/O
OPTIMIZED FOR AURORA TO GIVE YOU

BETTER PRICE, PERFORMANCE, AND
BETTER PREDICTABILITY OF PRICE.

WE GAVE YOU LIMITLESS DATABASE,
WHICH ALLOWED YOU TO HAVE

COMPLETELY UNLIMITED HORIZONTAL
SCALING OF YOUR DATABASES. AND

WE'VE ADDED VECTOR CAPABILITIES
IN AI INSIDE OF AURORA TO HELP

WITH GEN AI USE CASES. AND
THERE'S BEEN MANY OTHERS, AND WE

CONTINUE TO PUSH THE BOUNDARIES
OF COST, PERFORMANCE AND EASE OF

USE AND FUNCTIONALITY. SO THE
TEAM TOOK A LOOK AT ALL OF THESE

INNOVATIONS, AND THEY SAT DOWN
WITH SOME OF OUR VERY BEST DATA

BASED CUSTOMERS, AND THEY ASKED
THEM WHAT WOULD A PERFECT

DATABASE SOLUTION LOOK LIKE?
LIKE IF YOU JUST TAKE AWAY THE

CONSTRAINTS, WHAT WOULD A
PERFECT DATABASE LOOK LIKE? AND

THE CUSTOMERS TOLD US, LOOK, WE
ASSUME YOU CAN'T GIVE US

EVERYTHING, BUT IF YOU COULD,
WE'D LIKE A DATABASE THAT HAD

HIGH AVAILABILITY. THERE WAS, OF
COURSE, RUNNING MULTI-REGION

THAT OFFERED REALLY LOW LATENCY
FOR READS AND WRITES, OFFERED

STRONG CONSISTENCY, HAD, OF
COURSE, ZERO OPERATIONAL BURDEN

FOR THEM, AND OF COURSE HAD SQL
SEMANTICS. NOW THAT IS A LOT OF

ANDS. AND, YOU KNOW, A LOT OF
PEOPLE WILL TELL YOU YOU CAN'T

HAVE EVERYTHING. IN FACT, HOW
OFTEN ARE YOU GIVEN THE CHOICE

WHEN YOU'RE TRYING TO BUILD
SOMETHING OR YOU'RE TRYING TO

SAY, DO YOU WANT A OR B? AND THE
PROBLEM AND THIS IS AN

INTERESTING WHEN YOU HAVE TO
PICK A OR B, IT ACTUALLY KIND OF

LIMITS YOUR THINKING. AND SO AT
AMAZON THAT'S NOT HOW WE THINK

ABOUT IT. IN FACT WE CALL THAT
THE TYRANNY OF THE OR. IT

CREATES THESE FALSE BOUNDARIES,
RIGHT? YOU INSTANTLY START

THINKING I HAVE TO DO A OR B,
BUT WE PUSH TEAMS TO THINK ABOUT

HOW YOU DO A AND B, AND IT
REALLY STARTS TO HELP YOU THINK

DIFFERENTLY. NOW LOOK, THERE ARE
DATABASES OUT THERE THAT WILL

GIVE YOU SOME OF THESE
CAPABILITIES ALREADY. SOMETIMES

YOU CAN GET A DATABASE TODAY
THAT'LL GIVE YOU LOW LATENCY AND

HIGH AVAILABILITY, BUT YOU CAN'T
GET STRONG CONSISTENCY OUT OF

THOSE. NOW THERE'S OTHER
DATABASE OFFERINGS THAT ARE

GLOBAL AND HAVE STRONG
CONSISTENCY AND HIGH

AVAILABILITY IN ACROSS MULTIPLE
REGIONS. BUT FOR THOSE THE

LATENCY IS REALLY, REALLY HIGH.
AND FORGET SQL COMPATIBILITY

WITH THOSE. SO WE CHALLENGED
OURSELVES TO GO SOLVE FOR THE

END. AND IT TURNS OUT BECAUSE WE
CONTROL THE END TO END

ENVIRONMENT FOR AURORA, RIGHT?
WE CONTROL THE ENGINE. WE

CONTROL THE INFRASTRUCTURE, WE
CONTROL THE INSTANCES,

EVERYTHING WE CAN CHANGE A LOT
OF THINGS. AND SO ONE OF THE

THINGS WE FIRST DID IS LOOK AT
THE CORE DATABASE ENGINE, HOW IT

WORKS IN COMBINATION WITH OUR
GLOBAL FOOTPRINT, TO SEE IF THAT

MIGHT HELP US DELIVER. AND SO
THE FIRST BIG PROBLEM WE NEEDED

TO TACKLE, IF WE WERE REALLY
GOING TO DELIVER ALL THESE

CAPABILITIES, IS HOW WOULD WE
ACHIEVE MULTI-REGION, STRONG

CONSISTENCY WHILE ALSO
DELIVERING LOW LATENCY. THAT IS

A REALLY HARD PROBLEM. SO YOU'VE
GOT THESE APPS THAT ARE WRITING

ACROSS REGIONS, RIGHT? AND WHEN
YOU DO THAT, THE TRANSACTIONS

NEED TO BE SEQUENCED IN THE
RIGHT WAY SO THAT YOUR APP SO

THAT ALL OF YOUR APPLICATIONS
ARE GUARANTEED TO READ THE

LATEST DATA RIGHT. BUT WHEN YOU
DO THAT, YOU TYPICALLY TAKE A

LOCK ON THE DATA TO AVOID
CONFLICTS SO THAT YOU CAN WRITE

ALL BACK AND FORTH. NOW IT TURNS
OUT YOU CAN ACTUALLY DO THIS

TODAY WITH THE DATABASE ENGINES
AND HOW THEY OPERATE. BUT IT'S

INCREDIBLY SLOW AND ACTUALLY,
I'LL TAKE A SECOND TO EXPLAIN

WHY. SO A TYPICAL LET'S JUST SAY
WE HAVE AN ACTIVE ACTIVE

DATABASE SETUP ACROSS TWO
REGIONS. AND WE WANT TO COMPLETE

A TRANSACTION MUCH LIKE THIS
ONE. THIS TRANSACTION HAS ABOUT

TEN STATEMENTS TO IT, WHICH IS,
I THINK PRETTY AVERAGE FOR A

DATABASE STATEMENT AND A
TRADITIONAL DATABASE. WHAT WOULD

HAPPEN IS YOU'RE IN A SINGLE
REGION OR A SINGLE LOCATION, AND

YOU'D DO TEN COMMITS BETWEEN THE
APPLICATION AND THE DATABASE.

AND IF YOU'RE ALL IN THE SAME
LOCATION, THE LATENCY IS REALLY

FAST. AND THIS JUST WORKS FINE.
AND THAT'S HOW DATABASES ARE

OPERATED AND HOW THEY'VE BUILT
FROM THE BEGINNING. BUT NOW

LET'S SAY YOU'RE DOING THAT
ACROSS REGIONS. IT BECOMES

REALLY SLOW COMMUNICATION
ACTUALLY HAS TO GO BACK AND

FORTH TEN TIMES. RIGHT. AND SO
BEFORE THAT CAN ACTUALLY COMMIT.

SO IN THIS EXAMPLE LET'S SAY WE
HAVE A DATABASE RUNNING IN

VIRGINIA. AND ANOTHER ONE
RUNNING IN TOKYO OKAY. THE ROUND

TRIP IS ABOUT 158 MILLISECONDS
BETWEEN VIRGINIA AND TOKYO. NOW

IN THIS EXAMPLE, THAT DATA HAS
GOT TO GO BACK AND FORTH TEN

TIMES, RIGHT, TO COMMIT ALL
EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THOSE BITS

OF THE TRANSACTION. THAT'S 1.6
SECONDS. AND IF YOU ADD MORE

REGIONS, IT ACTUALLY BECOMES
EVEN SLOWER. SO THAT IS WAY TOO

SLOW FOR TODAY'S APPLICATIONS.
FOR MOST USE CASES. NOW, GIVEN

HOW DATABASES OPERATE, THIS IS A
BIT OF A PHYSICS PROBLEM.

UNFORTUNATELY, YOU'RE ALL GOING
TO HAVE TO WAIT FOR US AT AWS TO

SOLVE THE SPEED OF LIGHT UNTIL A
FUTURE RE:INVENT. BUT TODAY WE

ARE GOING TO LOOK AT
FUNDAMENTALLY HOW YOU CHANGE HOW

THIS DATABASE ENGINE WORKS. WE
HAD THIS THOUGHT WHAT IF WE

BUILT AN ARCHITECTURE THAT COULD
ELIMINATE ALL THOSE DIFFERENT

ROUND TRIPS? IF YOU DIDN'T HAVE
TO DO THOSE, YOU COULD REDUCE

THE LATENCY BY 90%. INSTEAD OF A
1.6 SECOND TRANSACTION, YOU

COULD HAVE A 158 MILLISECOND
TRANSACTION. SO WE DEVELOPED A

WHOLE NEW WAY TO PROCESS
TRANSACTIONS. WE ACTUALLY

SEPARATED THE TRANSACTION
PROCESSING FROM THE STORAGE

LAYER. SO YOU DON'T NEED EVERY
SINGLE ONE OF THOSE STATEMENTS

TO GO CHECK AT COMMIT TIME. YOU
INSTEAD YOU DO THE SINGLE ON

COMMIT. WE PARALLELIZE ALL OF
THE WRITES AT THE SAME TIME

ACROSS ALL OF THE REGIONS, SO
YOU CAN GET STRONG CONSISTENCY

ACROSS REGIONS WITH SUPER FAST
WRITES TO THE DATABASE. HOWEVER,

THOSE OF YOU THAT ARE PAYING
ATTENTION MIGHT HAVE NOTICED

THIS INTRODUCES A SECOND MAJOR
PROBLEM THAT AS YOU'RE WRITING

ALL OF THOSE INDEPENDENTLY
ACROSS VARIOUS REGIONS, HOW DO

YOU GET ALL THOSE TRANSACTIONS
TO COMMIT IN THE ORDER THAT THEY

OCCURRED? BECAUSE IF THAT
DOESN'T HAPPEN, YOU GET

CORRUPTION AND BAD PROBLEMS
HAPPEN. YOU HAVE TO MAKE SURE

ALL OF THOSE ARE ORDERED
CORRECTLY. NOW, AGAIN, IN

THEORY, THIS ARCHITECTURE WOULD
WORK GREAT IF YOUR CLOCKS WERE

PERFECTLY SYNCED BECAUSE IN A IN
A TRADITIONAL DATABASE, YOU JUST

SIMPLY LOOK AT THE TIMESTAMPS
AND YOU CAN MAKE SURE THAT THOSE

ARE ALL IN ORDERED. BUT AS YOU
HAVE THESE DATABASES SPREAD

AROUND THE WORLD, YOU HAVE TO
DEAL WITH THIS PROBLEM THAT'S

KNOWN AS CLOCK DRIFT. WHAT
HAPPENS? AND MANY OF YOU ARE

SURE AWARE OF THIS, IS YOU GET
TIMES THAT ARE ALL SLIGHTLY OUT

OF SYNC. AND SO IT'S ACTUALLY
HARD TO KNOW IF THE TIME OVER

HERE IS THE SAME AS THE TIME
OVER HERE. HAVING THOSE

PERFECTLY SYNCED IS EASIER SAID
THAN DONE, BUT FORTUNATELY WE

CONTROL THE GLOBAL
INFRASTRUCTURE ALL THE WAY DOWN

TO THE COMPONENT LEVEL. AND SO
WE ADDED THIS BUILDING BLOCK

CALLED THE AMAZON TIME SYNC TO
SERVICE EC2. WHAT WE DID IS WE

ADDED A HARDWARE REFERENCE CLOCK
IN EVERY SINGLE EC2 INSTANCE ALL

AROUND THE WORLD. AND THOSE
HARDWARE REFERENCE CLOCKS SYNC

WITH SATELLITE CONNECTED ATOMIC
CLOCKS. SO THAT MEANS THAT EVERY

EC2 INSTANCE NOW HAS MICROSECOND
PRECISION, ACCURATE TIME THAT'S

IN SYNC WITH ANY INSTANCE
ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD. NOW

THAT'S ABOUT AS TECH DIVE DEEP
AS I'M GOING TO GO TODAY. AND

WERNER IS GOING TO GO A LOT
DEEPER IN HIS TALK ON THURSDAY.

SO IF YOU'RE INTERESTED, I
ENCOURAGE YOU TO CHECK OUT. BUT

THE NET IS THAT NOW THAT WE HAVE
MICROSECOND PRECISION TIME AND

THIS REDESIGNED TRANSACTION
ENGINE, ALL THE PIECES ARE THERE

FOR US TO DELIVER WHAT WE NEED
TO AVOID THOSE OR TRADE OFFS AND

DELIVER ON THE END. SO I AM
REALLY EXCITED TO ANNOUNCE

AMAZON AURORA D SQL.
[APPLAUSE]

THIS IS THE NEXT ERA OF AURORA
AURORA DE SQL IS THE FASTEST

DISTRIBUTED SQL DATABASE
ANYWHERE AND DELIVERS THE NEXT

GENERATION OF END AURORA DSQL
DELIVERS VIRTUALLY UNLIMITED

SCALE ALL ACROSS REGIONS, WITH
ZERO INFRASTRUCTURE MANAGEMENT

FOR YOU AND A FULLY SERVERLESS
DESIGN THAT SCALES DOWN TO ZERO.

AURORA SQL DELIVERS FIVE NINES
OF AVAILABILITY. IT'S STRONGLY

CONSISTENT. YOU GET LOW LATENCY
READS AND WRITES, AND AURORA SQL

IS POSTGRES COMPATIBLE, SO IT'S
REALLY EASY TO START USING TODAY.

SO WE WANT TO SEE HOW THIS NEW
OFFERING WOULD COMPARE AGAINST

GOOGLE SPANNER, WHICH IS
PROBABLY THE CLOSEST OFFERING

OUT THERE TODAY. SO WE DID A
MULTI-REGION SETUP AND WE

BENCHMARKED COMMITTING THAT
SAME, JUST THAT SAME TEN

STATEMENT TRANSACTION THAT WE
SAW EARLIER. AND IT TURNS OUT

THAT AURORA DELIVERS FOUR X
FASTER READS AND WRITES THAN

SPANNER. PRETTY AWESOME. AND
WE'RE REALLY EXCITED TO SEE HOW

YOU'RE GOING TO LEVERAGE THIS IN
YOUR APPLICATIONS.

[APPLAUSE]
BUT ONE MORE THING. IT TURNS OUT

THAT RELATIONAL DATABASES ARE
NOT THE ONLY ONES THAT BENEFIT

FROM MULTI-REGION, STRONGLY
CONSISTENT, LOW LATENCY

CAPABILITIES. SO I'M ALSO
PLEASED TO ANNOUNCE THAT WE'RE

ADDING THE SAME MULTI-REGION,
STRONG CONSISTENCY TO DYNAMODB

GLOBAL TABLES.
[APPLAUSE]

SO NOW WHETHER YOU'RE RUNNING
SQL OR NOSQL, YOU GET THE BEST

OF ALL WORLDS ACTIVE, ACTIVE,
MULTI-REGION DATABASES WITH

STRONG CONSISTENCY, LOW LATENCY,
AND HIGH AVAILABILITY. THIS TYPE

OF CORE INNOVATION IN THESE
FUNDAMENTAL BUILDING BLOCKS IS

WHY SOME OF THE BIGGEST
ENTERPRISES IN THE WORLD TRUST

AWS WITH THEIR WORKLOADS. ONE OF
THOSE COMPANIES IS JPMORGAN

CHASE. IN 2020, WE HAD JPMC CIO
LORI BEER ON STAGE TO TALK ABOUT

HOW THEY WERE STARTING THEIR
CLOUD MIGRATION TO AWS. NOW,

OVER THE PAST FOUR YEARS, THE
TEAM AT JPMC HAVE BEEN DOING A

TON OF WORK TO MODERNIZE THEIR
INFRASTRUCTURE, AND I'M REALLY

EXCITED TO WELCOME BACK LAURIE
TO SHARE WHERE THEY ARE IN THEIR

JOURNEY. PLEASE WELCOME LAURIE
BEER.

[MUSIC]
GOOD MORNING. JPMORGAN CHASE IS

A 225 YEAR OLD INSTITUTION THAT
SERVES CUSTOMERS, CLIENTS,

BUSINESSES AND GOVERNMENTS
ACROSS THE GLOBE. OUR STATED

PURPOSE IS TO MAKE DREAMS
POSSIBLE FOR EVERYONE,

EVERYWHERE, EVERY DAY. AND WE DO
THIS AT TREMENDOUS SCALE. WE

SERVE 82 MILLION CUSTOMERS IN
THE US, FINANCING HOME OWNERSHIP,

EDUCATION AND OTHER FAMILY
MILESTONES. WE BANK MORE THAN

90% OF FORTUNE 500 COMPANIES AND
EVERY DAY WE PROCESS. $10

90% OF FORTUNE 500 COMPANIES AND
EVERY DAY WE PROCESS. $10

TRILLION OF PAYMENTS. ALL OF
THIS IS WHY WE INVEST $17

BILLION IN TECHNOLOGY AND HAVE
AN AMBITIOUS MODERNIZATION

AGENDA TO DRIVE GROWTH. WE HAVE
44,000 SOFTWARE ENGINEERS WHO

RUN MORE THAN 6000 APPLICATIONS
AND MANAGE NEARLY AN EXABYTE OF

DATA FROM MARKETS, CUSTOMERS,
PRODUCTS, RISK AND COMPLIANCE,

AND MORE. SOME OF YOU MAY
REMEMBER I SPOKE AT RE:INVENT

FOUR YEARS AGO AND IT'S GREAT TO
BE BACK TO UPDATE YOU ON OUR

PROGRESS AND WHILE THE INDUSTRY
HAS EVOLVED DRAMATICALLY OVER

THE PAST FOUR YEARS, THE CORE
PRINCIPLES OF OUR CLOUD PROGRAM

HAVE NOT. WE ARE STILL FOCUSED
ON ESTABLISHING A STRONG

SECURITY FOUNDATION THAT IS
RESILIENT AND REPRESENTS OUR

ROBUST REGULATORY FRAMEWORK.
PRIORITIZING MODERNIZATION

ACROSS BOTH THE BUSINESS AND
TECHNOLOGY, ENABLING INNOVATIVE

SERVICES LIKE AI AND SERVERLESS
TO DRIVE NEW PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT

AND ACCELERATE OUR GO TO MARKET.
BEING THOUGHTFUL AND

PRIORITIZING MIGRATION FOR THE
MOST IMPACTFUL USE CASES. THESE

PRINCIPLES HAVE ENABLED TO US
SUPPORT AND DRIVE BUSINESS

GROWTH. TODAY, WE PROCESS MORE
THAN 50% OF E-COMMERCE

TRANSACTIONS IN THE UNITED
STATES. THINK ABOUT THE VOLUME

FROM THIS PAST WEEKEND, WHICH
KICKED OFF THE BUSIEST SHOPPING

SEASON OF THE YEAR. WHEN OUR
BUSINESS IS THAT CRITICAL TO THE

WORLD ECONOMY, RESILIENCY IS
CORE IN EVERYTHING WE DO. THIS

IS WHY WE HAVE BEEN REINVENTING
THE WAY WE BUILD GLOBAL BANKING

AND PAYMENTS INFRASTRUCTURE, AND
WHY WE'VE PUSHED THE ELEMENT OF

THE ART OF THE POSSIBLE IN THE
CLOUD. WE'VE BEEN ON OUR CLOUD

JOURNEY WITH AWS FOR SEVERAL
YEARS. OUR FIRST APPS LEVERAGED

KEY SERVICES LIKE EC2, S3, EKS A
FAST FORWARD A FEW YEARS. IN

2020, WE REACHED OUR MILESTONE
OF 100 APPLICATIONS ON THE

CLOUD. IN 2021, WE DOUBLED THAT
AND EXPANDED INTO EUROPE,

INCLUDING LAUNCHING OUR CONSUMER
BANK CHASE IN THE UK. BUILT FROM

THE GROUND UP ON AWS IN 2022, WE
STARTED USING AWS GRAVITON CHIPS

AND SAW INCREASED PERFORMANCE
BENEFITS, AND IN 2023 WE STARTED

LEVERAGING GPUS AND BY THEN HAD
NEARLY A THOUSAND APPLICATIONS

RUNNING ON AWS, INCLUDING CORE
SERVICES LIKE DEPOSITS AND

PAYMENTS. TODAY, WE'RE ACTIVELY
UNLOCKING GENAI USE CASES AND

WORKING WITH AWS ON THEIR
BEDROCK ROADMAP. THE WAY WE HAVE

ARCHITECTED ON THE CLOUD HAS
ALLOWED US TO MODERNIZE OUR

BUSINESS PLATFORMS AND BUILD
BRAND NEW ONES, ENABLING US TO

CONTINUOUSLY INNOVATE. THREE
EXAMPLES OF MODERNIZATION CAN BE

SEEN IN OUR MARKETS AND PAYMENTS
BUSINESSES, AS WELL AS CHASE.COM

FOR OUR FLAGSHIP PLATFORMS AND
MARKETS AND PAYMENTS. MASSIVE

AMOUNTS OF ELASTIC COMPUTE AND
MODERN CLOUD SERVICES HAVE

HELPED US ANALYZE RISK AND
MARKET VOLATILITY. IT ALSO

ENABLES US TO BE ONE OF THE
LARGEST PAYMENT PROCESSORS IN

THE WORLD. TWO YEARS AGO, WE
SUCCESSFULLY MIGRATED CHASE.COM,

OUR FLAGSHIP CONSUMER APP THAT
ALSO POWERS OUR MOBILE

EXPERIENCE. WE MIGRATED IT TO
AWS, REDUCING COSTS AND

UPLIFTING OUR RESILIENCY. HOW
DID WE DO IT? WE USE ACTIVE,

ACTIVE, ACTIVE CONFIGURATION
ACROSS MULTIPLE AWS REGIONS. THE

STRONG RESILIENCY POSTURE ALLOWS
TWO OUT OF THREE REGIONS TO FAIL

WITHOUT CUSTOMER IMPACT, BUT GEO
OPTIMIZED ROUTING ALSO IMPROVED

OUR OVERALL CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE.
OUR STRONG PARTNERSHIP WITH AWS

ENSURES THAT THE INFRASTRUCTURE
STACK IS FREQUENTLY AND

AUTOMATICALLY REFRESHED TO
IMPROVE OUR RISK AND RESILIENCY

POSTURE AND MEET OUR SECURITY
CONTROLS. WE ALSO LAUNCHED A NEW

BUSINESS WHICH LEVERAGES AWS
FUSION, OFFERS A

DATA MANAGEMENT PLATFORM
AND ANALYTICS ACROSS INVESTMENT

LIFE CYCLES, IMPROVING
INTEROPERABILITY ACROSS MULTIPLE

DATA SOURCES, AND PROVIDING OUR
INSTITUTIONAL CLIENTS ACCESS TO

DATA SOURCES, AND PROVIDING OUR
INSTITUTIONAL CLIENTS ACCESS TO

EXTENSIVE FOUNDATIONS OF DATA AT
SCALE. IT IS JUST ONE EXAMPLE OF

A DATA MANAGEMENT SOLUTION WE
HAVE AT THE FIRM I MENTIONED

EARLIER. WE HAVE NEARLY AN
EXABYTE OF DATA, WHICH MAKES IT

ONE OF OUR MOST CRITICAL ASSETS,
ESPECIALLY AS WE INCREASINGLY

EMBED AI IN THE WAY WE MODERNIZE
AND BUILD OUR TECHNOLOGY WITH

THE HELP OF AWS DATA MANAGEMENT
TOOLS LIKE GLUE, OUR DATA IS

DISCOVERABLE, ACCESSIBLE,
INTEROPERABLE, AND REUSABLE ON

OUR SECURE END TO END DATA AND
AI PLATFORM. THIS PLATFORM IS

EMPOWERING US TO BUILD THE NEXT
WAVE OF AI APPLICATIONS AT THE

FIRM. SAGEMAKER IS HELPING US
SIMPLIFY THE MODEL DEVELOPMENT

LIFE CYCLE FROM EXPERIMENTATION
TO MODEL DEPLOYMENT. IN

PRODUCTION. IT IS THE FOUNDATION
OF OUR FIRMWIDE AI PLATFORM,

WHICH WE DESIGNED TO BE
REPEATABLE WITH AN EXTENSIBLE

ARCHITECTURE SO THAT OUR DATA
SCIENTISTS CAN LEVERAGE A RANGE

OF BEST IN CLASS SOLUTIONS FROM
THE ECOSYSTEM. OVER 5000

EMPLOYEES USE SAGEMAKER EVERY
MONTH, AND WE'RE NOW STARTING TO

EXPLORE BEDROCK, WITH THE GOAL
OF PROVIDING DATA SCIENTISTS

WITH SEAMLESS ACCESS TO MORE
MODELS THAT CAN BE FINE TUNED ON

OUR DATA. OUR GOAL IS TO USE
GENAI AT SCALE, AND WE CONTINUE

TO LEARN HOW TO BEST LEVERAGE
THESE NEW INNOVATIVE

CAPABILITIES WITHIN THE
REGULATED ENTERPRISE. WE ROLLED

OUT LLM C-SUITE, OUR INTERNAL AI
ASSISTANT TO ABOUT 200,000

EMPLOYEES, AND WE'RE ALREADY
SEEING VALUE FROM SOME OF OUR

OTHER GENAI USE CASES. OUR
BANKERS AND ADVISORS RECEIVE AI

GENERATED IDEAS TO BETTER ENGAGE
WITH CLIENTS. OUR TRAVEL AGENTS

LEVERAGE LLMS TO HELP BUILD AND
BOOK TRIP ITINERARIES FOR OUR

CUSTOMERS. OUR CONTACT CENTER
REPS SUMMARIZE, CALL

TRANSCRIPTS, AND PROVIDE
INSIGHTS AT SCALE, AND OUR

DEVELOPERS ARE USING AI CODE
GENERATION TOOLS. WE'RE

CURRENTLY EXPLORING WAYS TO
LEVERAGE DEVELOPER AI AGENTS IN

PARALLEL. THERE'S NEVER BEEN A
MORE EXCITING TIME TO BE LEADING

AN ENTERPRISE THROUGH A
TRANSFORMATION, GIVING ALL THE

TECHNOLOGY THAT PROVIDERS LIKE
AWS ARE BRINGING TO MARKET. I'M

EXCITED FOR THE NEXT WAVE OF
TECHNOLOGY EVOLUTION, AND I'M

PROUD THAT JPMORGAN CHASE IS
WELL POSITIONED TO DELIVER THE

FUTURE OF FINANCIAL SERVICES.
THANK YOU.

[APPLAUSE]
[APPLAUSE]

[MUSIC]
THANKS A LOT FOR COMING BACK.

IT'S GREAT TO SEE HOW FAR YOUR
TEAMS HAVE COME IN THE LAST FOUR

YEARS, AND IT'S AWESOME TO SEE
HOW THE MODERNIZATION EFFORTS

ARE ACTUALLY PAYING DIVIDENDS IN
INCREASED AGILITY. BUT ALSO IT'S

REALLY SETTING THE TEAM UP AT
JPMC TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF NEW

TECHNOLOGIES LIKE GENERATIVE AI.
ALL RIGHT. SO WE TALKED ABOUT

WANTING THIS SET OF BUILDING
BLOCKS THAT BUILDERS COULD USE

TO INVENT ANYTHING THAT THEY
COULD IMAGINE. AND WE ALSO

TALKED ABOUT HOW IN MANY OF THE
CASES THAT WE'VE WALKED THROUGH

TODAY, THAT WE'VE REDEFINED HOW
PEOPLE THOUGHT ABOUT THESE AS

APPLICATIONS CHANGED. NOW
PEOPLE'S EXPECTATIONS ARE

ACTUALLY CHANGING FOR
APPLICATIONS. AGAIN, WITH

GENERATIVE AI. AND INCREASINGLY,
MY VIEW IS GENERATIVE AI

INFERENCE IS GOING TO BE A CORE
BUILDING BLOCK FOR EVERY SINGLE

APPLICATION. IN FACT, I THINK
GENERATIVE AI ACTUALLY HAS THE

POTENTIAL TO TRANSFORM EVERY
SINGLE INDUSTRY, EVERY SINGLE

POTENTIAL TO TRANSFORM EVERY
SINGLE INDUSTRY, EVERY SINGLE

COMPANY OUT THERE, EVERY SINGLE
WORKFLOW OUT THERE, EVERY SINGLE

USER EXPERIENCE OUT THERE. AND
LOOK AT WHAT'S ALREADY

HAPPENING. IF YOU LOOK AT IN THE
FINSERV WORLD, THEY'RE ALREADY

USING GENERATIVE AI TO DETECT
MARKET MANIPULATION. YOU SEE

DRUG COMPANIES LIKE EVOLUTIONARY
SCALE THAT TALKED EARLIER. WE'RE

USING THIS TO DISCOVER NEW DRUGS
FASTER THAN YOU EVER COULD

BEFORE. PERSONALLY, I LOVE
WATCHING FOOTBALL. ON THURSDAY

NIGHT FOOTBALL AND I CAN SEE
BEFORE A PLAY HAPPENS A NEXT GEN

STATS PREDICTIONS WHEN A BLITZER
IS MAYBE GOING TO RUSH THE

QUARTERBACK. IT'S PRETTY FUN TO
WATCH THAT AND SEE HOW YOU CAN

CHANGE THOSE USER EXPERIENCE.
AND WE'RE JUST AT THE BEGINNING

NOW, TODAY, WHEN YOU HEAR A LOT
OF CUSTOMERS TALK ABOUT IT,

THEY'LL TALK ABOUT APPLICATIONS
AND GENERATIVE AI APPLICATIONS.

BUT INCREASINGLY I THINK
INFERENCE IS GOING TO BE PART OF

EVERY SINGLE APPLICATION.
THERE'S NOT GOING TO BE THIS

DIVIDE. EVERY APPLICATION IS
GOING TO USE INFERENCE IN SOME

WAY TO ENHANCE OR BUILD OR
REALLY CHANGE AN APPLICATION.

AND IF YOU'RE GOING TO REALLY DO
THAT, IT MEANS YOU NEED A

AND IF YOU'RE GOING TO REALLY DO
THAT, IT MEANS YOU NEED A

PLATFORM THAT CAN DELIVER
INFERENCE AT SCALE. IT MEANS

YOU'RE GOING TO NEED TOOLS TO
HELP YOU INTEGRATE THAT INTO

YOUR DATA. AND YOU'RE GOING TO
HAVE TO HAVE ALL THE RIGHT

PERFORMANCE, ALL OF THE RIGHT
SECURITY, AND ALL OF THE RIGHT

COST. NOW, THIS IS WHY WE BUILT
BEDROCK. BEDROCK IS BY FAR THE

EASIEST WAY TO BUILD AND SCALE
GENERATIVE AI APPLICATIONS, BUT

ONE OF THE THINGS THAT BEDROCK
IS PARTICULARLY GOOD AT, AND

WHERE IT'S REALLY RESONATED WITH
CUSTOMERS, IS IT GIVES YOU

EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO ACTUALLY
INTEGRATE GENERATIVE AI INTO

PRODUCTION APPLICATIONS, NOT
JUST PROOF OF CONCEPTS. AND

CUSTOMERS ARE STARTING TO SEE
REAL IMPACT FROM THIS. LET'S

TAKE, FOR EXAMPLE, GENENTECH.
THEY'RE A LEADING BIOTECH AND

PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANY, AND THEY
WERE LOOKING AT HOW THEY COULD

ACCELERATE DRUG DISCOVERY AND
DEVELOPMENT USING A BUNCH OF

SCIENTIFIC DATA AND AI TO
RAPIDLY IDENTIFY AND TARGET NEW

MEDICINE AND BIOMARKERS FOR
THEIR TRIALS. BUT FINDING ALL

THIS DATA REQUIRES SCIENTISTS TO
SCOUR THROUGH HUGE NUMBER OF

SOURCES, LIKE THE PUBMED LIBRARY
OF 35 MILLION DIFFERENT

BIOMEDICAL JOURNALS, PUBLIC
REPOSITORIES LIKE THE HUMAN

PROTEIN ATLAS AND THEIR OWN
INTERNAL DATA SOURCE THAT HAS

HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF
DIFFERENT CELLS THAT HAVE DATA

AROUND THEM WITH AMAZON BEDROCK,
GENENTECH DESIGNED A GENAI

SYSTEM WHERE SCIENTISTS CAN
ACTUALLY ASK THE DATA DETAILED

QUESTIONS. THEY CAN ASK THE DATA
WHAT CELL SURFACE RECEPTORS ARE

ENRICHED IN SPECIFIC CELLS. IN
INFLAMMATORY BOWEL DISEASE, A

QUESTION I'M SURE MANY OF YOU
ARE VERY INTERESTED IN ASKING

FREQUENTLY, BUT FOR THEM, IT'S
REALLY CRITICAL BECAUSE THIS

SYSTEM CAN IDENTIFY THE
APPROPRIATE PAPERS AND DATA FROM

THIS HUGE LIBRARY. AND IT
SYNTHESIZES ALL THE INSIGHTS AND

DATA SOURCES. IT SUMMARIZES
WHERE IT GETS THE INFORMATION

AND CITES THE SOURCES, WHICH IS
INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT FOR

SCIENTIFIC REASONS AND
TRACEABILITY. AND THEY HAVE THAT

DATA THAT THEY CAN GO AND DO
THEIR WORK. THIS WAS A PROCESS

THAT USED TO TAKE GENENTECH
SCIENTISTS MANY WEEKS JUST TO DO

ONE OF THESE LOOKUPS, AND NOW IT
CAN BE DONE IN A MATTER OF

MINUTES. GENENTECH IS EXPECTING
TO AUTOMATE NEARLY FIVE YEARS OF

MANUAL EFFORT AND ULTIMATELY
DELIVER NEW MEDICATIONS TO

CUSTOMERS. MORE QUICKLY. NOW,
TENS OF THOUSANDS OF CUSTOMERS

EVERY DAY ARE USING BEDROCK FOR
PRODUCTION APPLICATIONS. THAT IS

NEARLY FIVE X THE GROWTH IN THE
LAST YEAR ALONE. AND IT'S NOT

JUST AWS CUSTOMERS DIRECTLY.
MANY OF THE WORLD'S LEADING ISVS

LIKE SALESFORCE AND SAP AND
WORKDAY, ARE INTEGRATING BEDROCK

DEEP INTO THEIR CUSTOMER
EXPERIENCES TO DELIVER GENAI

APPLICATIONS TO ALL OF THEIR END
CUSTOMERS. SO WHY EXACTLY IS

EVERYBODY USING BEDROCK? PART OF
IT IS WE HAD THIS OBSERVATION

THAT IT'S NOT JUST ONE MODEL
THAT EVERYONE WAS GOING TO WANT

TO USE. THERE IS A LOT OF
DIFFERENT MODELS THAT PEOPLE

WERE GOING TO WANT TO TAKE
ADVANTAGE OF. SOME CUSTOMERS

WANTED OPEN WEIGHTS MODELS LIKE
A LLAMA OR A MISTRAL THAT THEY

COULD CUSTOMIZE. SOME CUSTOMER
APPLICATIONS NEEDED IMAGE MODELS

LIKE THOSE FROM STABILITY OR
FROM TITAN, AND MANY CUSTOMERS

ARE REALLY ENJOYING USING THE
LATEST ANTHROPIC MODELS, WHICH

MANY CONSIDER TO BE THE BEST
PERFORMING MODELS IN THE MARKET

TODAY. FOR GENERAL INTELLIGENCE
AND REASONING. BUT THIS IS A

SPACE WHERE INNOVATION IS
HAPPENING REALLY FAST. THERE'S

ALMOST NEW RELEASES ALMOST EVERY
SINGLE WEEK, NEW CAPABILITIES,

NEW MODELS, NEW UPDATES, AND NEW
COSTS. BUT ACTUALLY, WITH ALL

THAT INNOVATION AND ALL THOSE
MODELS, IT'S STILL ACTUALLY

SURPRISINGLY HARD TO FIND A
PERFECT MODEL FOR YOUR USE CASE.

A LOT OF TIMES WHAT YOU WANT IS
YOU WANT THE RIGHT MIX OF

A LOT OF TIMES WHAT YOU WANT IS
YOU WANT THE RIGHT MIX OF

EXPERTISE FOR WHAT YOU'RE TRYING
TO ACCOMPLISH, WITH THE RIGHT

MIX OF LATENCY AND THE RIGHT
COST. BUT GETTING SOME OF THOSE

IS HARD, RIGHT? SOMETIMES YOU'LL
HAVE A MODEL THAT HAS THE RIGHT

EXPERTISE, RIGHT? IT'S THIS
REALLY SMART MODEL THAT'S REALLY

GOOD, BUT IT'S MORE EXPENSIVE
THAN YOU'D LIKE, AND IT'S

PROBABLY A LITTLE SLOWER THAN
YOU NEED FOR YOUR APPLICATION.

PROBABLY A LITTLE SLOWER THAN
YOU NEED FOR YOUR APPLICATION.

OTHER TIMES, YOU'LL FIND A MODEL
THAT'S FASTER AND CHEAPER, BUT

IT'S NOT AS CAPABLE AS WHAT YOU
NEED FOR NOW, ONE WAY THAT

PEOPLE ARE SOLVING FOR THIS IS
CALLED MODEL DISTILLATION. AND

WHAT MODEL DISTILLATION DOES IS
YOU TAKE THIS LARGE FRONTIER

MODEL. IN THIS EXAMPLE, IT'S A
LLAMA 405B MODEL, AND YOU TAKE

THIS HIGHLY CAPABLE MODEL AND
YOU SEND IT ALL YOUR PROMPTS,

RIGHT? ALL OF THE QUESTIONS THAT
YOU MIGHT WANT TO ASK IT. AND

THEN YOU TAKE ALL OF THE DATA
AND THE ANSWERS THAT COME OUT OF

THAT. AND TOGETHER WITH THE
QUESTIONS YOU USE THAT TO TRAIN

A SMALLER MODEL, IN THIS CASE,
LLAMA 80 MODEL, TO BE AN EXPERT

AT THAT ONE PARTICULAR THING. SO
YOU GET THIS SMALLER, FASTER

MODEL THAT DOES KNOW THE EXPERT
ON HOW TO ANSWER THESE ONE

PARTICULAR SET OF QUESTIONS IN
THE RIGHT WAY. THIS ACTUALLY

WORKS QUITE WELL TO DELIVER AN
EXPERT MODEL, BUT IT REQUIRES ML

EXPERTS TO DO. IT'S ACTUALLY
PRETTY HARD. YOU HAVE TO MANAGE

ALL OF THESE DATA WORKFLOWS. YOU
HAVE TO MANAGE THAT TRAINING

DATA. YOU HAVE TO TUNE MODEL
PARAMETERS AND THINK ABOUT MODEL

WEIGHTS. AND IT'S PRETTY
CHALLENGING. WE WANTED TO MAKE

ALL OF THAT EASIER. SO TODAY I'M
HAPPY TO ANNOUNCE MODEL

DISTILLATION IN BEDROCK.
[APPLAUSE]

AND DISTILLED MODELS CAN RUN
500% FASTER AND 75% CHEAPER THAN

THE PREVIOUS. THE MODEL THAT
THEY GOT DISTILLED FROM. THIS IS

A MASSIVE DIFFERENCE, AND
BEDROCK DOES IT COMPLETELY FOR

YOU. THIS DIFFERENCE IN COST
ACTUALLY HAS THE POTENTIAL TO

COMPLETELY TURN AROUND THE ROI.
AS YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT IF A

GENERATIVE AI APPLICATION WORKS
FOR YOU OR NOT, RIGHT? IT

CHANGES IT FROM BEING TOO
EXPENSIVE TO YOU CAN'T ROLL IT

OUT IN PRODUCTION TO ACTUALLY
FLIPPING TO BE REALLY VALUABLE

FOR YOU. AND BEDROCK DOES ALL OF
THIS WORK FOR YOU. YOU SIMPLY

SEND BEDROCK YOUR SAMPLE PROMPTS
FROM YOUR APPLICATION, AND IT

DOES ALL OF THE WORK. ALL RIGHT,
SO AT THE END OF THE DAY, YOU

NOW HAVE A CUSTOM DISTILLED
MODEL WITH THE RIGHT MIX OF

EXPERTISE, LATENCY AND COST. BUT
GETTING THE RIGHT MODEL IS JUST

THE FIRST STEP. THE REAL VALUE,
THE REAL VALUE IN GENERATIVE AI

APPLICATIONS IS WHEN YOU TAKE
YOUR ENTERPRISE DATA AND BRING

IT TOGETHER WITH A SMART MODEL,
THAT'S WHEN YOU GET REALLY

DIFFERENTIATED AND INTERESTING
RESULTS THAT MATTER TO YOUR

CUSTOMERS, YOUR DATA AND YOUR IP
REALLY MAKE THE DIFFERENCE. AND

ONE OF THE MOST POPULAR WAYS OF
ADDING YOUR DATA INTO A MODEL

TOGETHER AND PULLING IT TOGETHER
IS A TECHNIQUE CALLED RETRIEVAL

AUGMENTED GENERATION, OR REG.
AND WHAT THIS DOES IS IT HELPS

YOUR MODELS DELIVER MORE
RELEVANT, ACCURATE AND

CUSTOMIZED RESPONSES THAT ARE
BASED ON YOUR ENTERPRISE DATA.

NOW EARLIER THIS YEAR, WE
LAUNCHED KNOWLEDGE BASES, WHICH

NOW EARLIER THIS YEAR, WE
LAUNCHED KNOWLEDGE BASES, WHICH

IS A MANAGED RAG INDEX AS PART
OF BEDROCK. WHAT IT DOES IS IT

AUTOMATES ALL OF YOUR DATA
INGESTION AND RETRIEVAL AND

AUGMENTATION WORKFLOWS SO THAT
YOU DON'T HAVE TO PUT THESE

THINGS TOGETHER, FULLY MANAGED.
ALL YOU DO IS YOU POINT

KNOWLEDGE BASES AT YOUR DATA
SOURCE AND WE AUTOMATICALLY

CONVERT THAT TO TEXT EMBEDDINGS
AND THEN WE STORE THEM IN A

VECTOR DATABASE FOR YOU. SO
YOU'RE READY TO GO.

AND ALL THE
RETRIEVALS WILL ALSO

AUTOMATICALLY INCLUDE CITATIONS.
SO YOU KNOW WHERE THE

INFORMATION CAME FROM AND
INCREASES YOUR LEVEL OF

UNDERSTANDABILITY. NOW,
KNOWLEDGE BASES IS ONE OF THE

MOST POPULAR FEATURES IN
BEDROCK, AND WE'VE BEEN ADDING A

TON OF NEW FEATURES. WE'VE
EXPANDED THE SUPPORT FOR A WIDE

RANGE OF FORMATS, AND WE'VE
ADDED NEW VECTOR DATABASES LIKE

OPENSEARCH, AND
PINECONE SUPPORT. OKAY, SO

BEDROCK NOW GIVES YOU YOU CAN
SEE IT'S BUILDING THESE TOOLS,

RIGHT? IT ALLOWS YOU TO GET THE
RIGHT MODEL. IT ALLOWS YOU TO

BRING YOUR OWN ENTERPRISE DATA.
NEXT, YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO BE

ABLE TO SET UP BOUNDARIES OF
WHAT APPLICATIONS CAN DO AND

WHERE THE RESPONSES LOOK LIKE.
AND FOR THAT, WE LAUNCHED

BEDROCK GUARDRAILS. BEDROCK
GUARDRAILS MAKE IT REALLY EASY

FOR YOU TO DEFINE THE SAFETY OF
YOUR APPLICATION AND FOR YOU TO

IMPLEMENT RESPONSIBLE AI CHECKS.
THEY'RE BASICALLY GUIDES TO YOUR

MODELS AND SO YOU ONLY WANT YOUR
GENERATIVE AI APPLICATIONS TO

TALK ABOUT THE RELEVANT TOPICS.
LET'S SAY, FOR INSTANCE, YOU

HAVE AN INSURANCE APPLICATION
AND YOU HAVE CUSTOMERS COMING

AND ASKING ABOUT VARIOUS
INSURANCE PRODUCTS YOU HAVE.

YOU'RE HAPPY FOR IT TO ANSWER
QUESTIONS ABOUT POLICY, BUT YOU

DON'T REALLY WANT IT TO ANSWER
QUESTIONS ABOUT POLITICS OR GIVE

HEALTH CARE ADVICE. RIGHT? YOU
WANT TO HAVE THESE GUARDRAILS

THAT SAY, I ONLY WANT YOU TO
ANSWER QUESTIONS IN THIS

PARTICULAR AREA. AND THIS IS A
HUGE CAPABILITY AS YOU THINK

ABOUT BUILDING, AGAIN,
PRODUCTION APPLICATIONS. AND

THIS IS WHERE THIS IS WHY
BEDROCK IS SO POPULAR. IF YOU

REMEMBER, LAST YEAR, LOTS OF
PEOPLE WERE BUILDING PROOF OF

CONCEPTS WHERE THESE THINGS
WEREN'T THAT IMPORTANT, RIGHT?

IT WAS OKAY TO HAVE MODELS JUST
DO COOL THINGS. NOW THAT YOU'RE

REALLY INTEGRATING THESE DEEPLY
INTO YOUR ENTERPRISE

APPLICATIONS, YOU NEED TO HAVE A
LOT OF THESE CAPABILITIES AS YOU

MOVE TO PRODUCTION APPLICATIONS.
BUT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT

ACTUALLY STOPS PEOPLE FROM
MOVING GENERATIVE AI INTO REAL

PRODUCTION, RIGHT INTO THE
THINGS THAT ARE MISSION

CRITICAL, IS THERE'S ONE MORE
PROBLEM THAT LOTS OF PEOPLE

WORRY ABOUT, AND THAT IS
HALLUCINATIONS NOW, BECAUSE IN

REALITY, AS GOOD AS THE MODELS
ARE TODAY, SOMETIMES THEY GET

THINGS WRONG. AND SO WHEN YOU
DID A PROOF OF CONCEPT LAST YEAR

OR THE YEAR BEFORE IT WAS OKAY,
90% WAS OKAY. BUT WHEN YOU

REALLY GET DOWN INTO THE DETAILS
AND A PRODUCTION APPLICATION,

THAT'S NOT OKAY. LET'S TAKE THE
INSURANCE EXAMPLE. LET'S SAY YOU

WALK INTO YOUR BATHROOM IN THE
MORNING AND YOU SEE THAT YOU'VE

SPRUNG A LEAK AND THERE'S WATER
ALL OVER THE FLOOR. SO YOU GO TO

YOUR INSURANCE WEBSITE AND YOU
WANT TO KNOW IF IT'S COVERED BY

YOUR INSURANCE. RIGHT. YOU NEED
AS THE INSURANCE COMPANY, IF

SOMEBODY IS ASKING YOU IF AN
INCIDENT IS COVERED BY THEIR

INSURANCE, YOU KIND OF NEED TO
GET THAT RIGHT. YOU NEED TO

ANSWER IT CORRECTLY. THAT'S ONE
WHERE YOU CAN'T SOMETIMES GET IT

WRONG. AND SO WE ASKED A GROUP
OF PEOPLE AT AMAZON TO ACTUALLY

THINK, DO WE HAVE ANY
TECHNOLOGIES AROUND THAT? WE

THINK THAT COULD BE APPLIED IN
NEW OR DIFFERENT WAYS THAT COULD

HELP US SOLVE THIS PROBLEM? AND
SO THE TEAM LOOKED AT A VARIETY

OF DIFFERENT TECHNIQUES, ONE OF
WHICH IS CALLED AUTOMATED

REASONING. NOW, AUTOMATED
REASONING IS ACTUALLY A FORM OF

AI THAT CAN PROVE SOMETHING IS
MATHEMATICALLY CORRECT. AND IT'S

TYPICALLY USED TO PROVE THAT A
SYSTEM IS WORKING AS SPECIFIED.

RIGHT? SO AUTOMATED REASONING
WORKS REALLY WELL WHEN YOU'VE

GOT SOMETHING THAT HAS A REALLY,
REALLY LARGE SURFACE AREA THAT'S

TOO BIG TO MANUALLY LOOK AT. BUT
AND YOU HAVE A CORPUS OF

KNOWLEDGE OF HOW THE SYSTEM IS
SUPPOSED TO WORK. AND WHEN IT'S

REALLY, REALLY IMPORTANT THAT
YOU GET THE ANSWER RIGHT NOW, IT

TURNS OUT AT AMAZON AWS, WE HAVE
SOME OF THE MOST CAPABLE AND

DEEPEST EXPERTS IN AUTOMATED
REASONING ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD,

AND WE USE IT IN AWS BEHIND THE
SCENES AND A NUMBER OF OUR

SERVICES. WE USE AUTOMATED
REASONING TO PROVE, AS AN

EXAMPLE THAT THE PERMISSIONS AND
ACCESS THAT YOU ALL DEFINE IN

YOUR IAM POLICIES ARE ACTUALLY
IMPLEMENTED IN THE WAY THAT YOU

INTEND THEM. WE CALL THIS
APPROACH PROVABLE PROVABLE

SECURITY. IN S3 WE ACTUALLY USE
AUTOMATED REASONING. WHAT WE DO

IS WE USE IT TO AUTOMATICALLY
CHECK SCENARIOS IN THE SOFTWARE.

THAT MAKES UP THE VAST MAJORITY
OF THE BIG CHUNK OF S3 STORAGE

SYSTEMS, AND WE CHECK THOSE WITH
AUTOMATED REASONING BEFORE

DEPLOYMENT THAT INCLUDES
VALIDATING THINGS LIKE CORRECT

BEHAVIOR IN RESPONSE TO
UNEXPECTED EVENTS. WE DO THIS TO

ENSURE THAT WE AREN'T
INTRODUCING RISKS TO

AVAILABILITY OR DURABILITY, AND
THAT ALL OF THOSE REMAIN

PROTECTED. AND WE USE IT
AUTOMATED REASONING IN A NUMBER

OF DIFFERENT AREAS. AND SO WE
THOUGHT, IS THERE A CHANCE THAT

THIS TECHNOLOGY COULD HELP US
WITH MODEL CORRECTNESS? SPOILER.

SINCE I'M TALKING ABOUT THIS ON
STAGE RIGHT NOW, THE ANSWER IS

OBVIOUSLY YES. SO TODAY I'M
HAPPY TO ANNOUNCE AMAZON BEDROCK

AUTOMATED REASONING CHECKS.
[APPLAUSE]

AUTOMATED REASONING CHECKS
PREVENT FACTUAL ERRORS DUE TO

MODEL HALLUCINATIONS. SO WHEN
YOU IMPLEMENT ONE OF THESE

AUTOMATED REASONING CHECKS, WHAT
HAPPENS IS BEDROCK CAN ACTUALLY

CHECK THAT THE FACTUAL
STATEMENTS MADE BY MODELS ARE

ACCURATE. AND THIS IS ALL BASED
ON SOUND MATHEMATICAL

VERIFICATIONS. AND IT'LL SHOW
YOU EXACTLY HOW IT REACHED THAT

CONCLUSION. SO LET'S TAKE THIS
INSURANCE EXAMPLE ONE MORE TIME

AS THE INSURANCE COMPANY, YOU
DECIDE TO IMPLEMENT AUTOMATED

REASONING CHECKS. SO WHAT YOU DO
IS YOU UPLOAD ALL YOUR POLICIES,

RIGHT. AND THEN THE AUTOMATED
REASONING SYSTEM INSIDE OF

BEDROCK AUTOMATICALLY DEVELOPS
RULES. AND THEN YOU GO THROUGH A

BUNCH OF ITERATIVE PROCESSES,
USUALLY TAKES ABOUT 20 OR 30

MINUTES MAYBE TO TUNE THE RIGHT
RESPONSES TO REALLY SAY, YES,

THIS IS HOW IT WORKS, OR THIS
IS, AND IT ASKS YOU QUESTIONS SO

THAT IT REALLY UNDERSTANDS HOW
THE POLICIES WORK. NOW GO BACK

TO MY BATHROOM EXAMPLE AND I
HAVE THIS LEAK. AUTOMATED

REASONING CAN SEE THE RESULT
COME IN. AND IF THE MODEL ISN'T

ACTUALLY SURE THAT THE ANSWER IS
RIGHT, IT'LL ACTUALLY SEND IT

BACK AND SAY SUGGEST OTHER
PROMPTS OR GIVE YOU AS THE AS

THE AS THE CUSTOMER IDEAS OF HOW
YOU CAN SEND THESE BACK TO THE

MODEL. AND ONCE THE AUTOMATED
REASONING CHECKS ARE ASSURED

THAT THE ANSWER IS RIGHT, ONLY
THEN WOULD YOU SEND IT BACK TO

THE CUSTOMER, SO YOU CAN BE 100%
SURE THAT YOU'RE SENDING

ACCURATE RESULTS TO YOUR
CUSTOMERS. THIS IS A CAPABILITY

YOU CANNOT GET ANYWHERE ELSE,
AND WE THINK IT'S GOING TO

REALLY HELP CUSTOMERS AS THEY
START BUILDING INFERENCE INTO

MISSION CRITICAL APPLICATIONS.
NOW, THERE IS A TON OF VALUE

THAT CUSTOMERS GET FROM GENAI
USE CASES TODAY, AND WE THINK A

BUNCH OF THESE CAPABILITIES HELP
THEM ADD THESE CAPABILITIES TO

MORE AND MORE APPLICATIONS. BUT
AND THERE'S THIS BUZZ OUT THERE

TODAY AND WE AGREE WITH IT, THAT
THE NEXT BIG LEAP IN VALUE IS

NOT JUST ABOUT GETTING GREAT
DATA, BUT IT'S ABOUT TAKING

ACTIONS AND DOING SOMETHING. AND
FOR THAT, WE HAVE BEDROCK AGENTS.

BEDROCK BEDROCK MAKES IT REALLY
EASY TO BUILD AGENTS AND CREATE

AGENTS THAT CAN EXECUTE TASKS
ACROSS ALL OF YOUR COMPANY

SYSTEMS AND YOUR DATA. BY USING
BEDROCK, YOU CAN QUICKLY BUILD

AGENTS SIMPLY BY USING NATURAL
LANGUAGE DESCRIBING WHAT YOU

WANT IT TO DO, AND THE AGENT CAN
THEN HANDLE THINGS LIKE SALES

ORDERS, OR COMPILE FINANCIAL
REPORTS, OR ANALYZE CUSTOMER

RETENTION EXAMPLES. NOW, WHAT WE
DO IS WE USE MODEL REASONING

BEHIND THE SCENES. IT BREAKS
DOWN THE WORKFLOWS, AND THEN THE

AGENTS ARE ABLE TO CALL THE
RIGHT APIS AND EXECUTE THE

ACTION THAT YOU WANT TO DO. NOW,
TODAY, THESE ACTIONS ACTUALLY OR

THESE AGENTS WORK QUITE WELL FOR
SIMPLE TASKS, A SIMPLE, ISOLATED

TASK WHERE IT CAN GO AND
ACCOMPLISH THESE TASKS. AND

ACTUALLY IT'S QUITE VALUABLE.
AND CUSTOMERS ARE GETTING A LOT

OF VALUE OUT OF BEDROCK AGENTS
ALREADY. BUT THE FEEDBACK WE GET

IS CUSTOMERS WANT MORE. THEY
WANT TO BE ABLE TO DO COMPLEX

TASKS ACROSS MAYBE HUNDREDS OF
DIFFERENT AGENTS AND DOING THEM

IN PARALLEL. BUT THAT'S SUPER
HARD AND ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO

COORDINATE. TODAY. LET'S USE AN
EXAMPLE AGAIN. LET'S SAY YOU RUN

A GLOBAL COFFEE CHAIN AND YOU
WANT TO CREATE A NUMBER OF

AGENTS TO HELP YOU GO ANALYZE
THE RISK OF OPENING UP A NEW

LOCATION. SO YOU'RE GOING TO
CREATE A BUNCH OF AGENTS. YOU

MIGHT CREATE ONE THAT ANALYZES
GLOBAL ECONOMIC FACTORS, MAYBE

LOOKS AT RELEVANT MARKET
DYNAMICS, MAYBE EVEN BUILDS A

FINANCIAL PROJECTION FOR AN
INDEPENDENT STORE. AND ALL SAID,

MAYBE YOU GO CREATE LIKE A DOZEN
AGENTS THAT CAN GO LOOK AT A

LOCATION AND COME BACK WITH
THESE INDIVIDUAL PIECES OF

INFORMATION. IT'S ACTUALLY QUITE
VALUABLE. BUT WHEN THEY COME

BACK, YOU STILL HAVE TO COMPILE
THEM TOGETHER, LOOK AT HOW THEY

MIGHT INTERACT WITH EACH OTHER
AND THEN FIGURE OUT HOW YOU

COMPARE AGAINST A WHOLE BUNCH OF
DIFFERENT REGIONS. ALL SAID,

THOUGH, IT'S MANAGEABLE.
HOWEVER, YOU'RE PROBABLY NOT

LOOKING AT ONE LOCATION IN
ISOLATION. YOU PROBABLY WANT TO

LOOK AT HUNDREDS OF LOCATIONS
FOR YOUR POTENTIAL COFFEE CHAIN

AND ACROSS THESE VARIOUS
DIFFERENT GEOS. AND WHEN YOU DO

THAT, IT TURNS OUT ALL OF THESE
AGENTS PROBABLY AREN'T WORKING

IN ISOLATION. AGENT A PROBABLY
HAS INFORMATION THAT COULD BE

RELEVANT TO THE SECOND AGENT,
AND SO YOU ACTUALLY WANT THEM TO

INTERACT AND SHARE INFORMATION
BACK AND FORTH. THAT GETS VERY

COMPLICATED. IF YOU THINK ABOUT
HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF AGENTS

ALL HAVING TO INTERACT, COME
BACK, SHARE DATA, GO BACK THAT

SUDDENLY THE COMPLEXITY OF
MANAGING THE SYSTEM HAS

BALLOONED TO BE COMPLETELY
UNMANAGEABLE. IT'S HUGELY

VALUABLE IF YOU COULD GET IT TO
WORK. BUT REALLY HARD. SO TODAY

I'M ANNOUNCING BEDROCK AGENTS
SUPPORT FOR MULTI-AGENT

COLLABORATION.
[APPLAUSE]

NOW, BEDROCK AGENTS CAN SUPPORT
COMPLEX WORKFLOWS. WHAT HAPPENS

IS YOU JUST LIKE IN THE EARLIER
EXAMPLE, YOU CREATE THESE SERIES

OF INDIVIDUAL AGENTS THAT ARE
REALLY DESIGNED FOR YOUR SPECIAL

AND INDIVIDUALIZED TASKS. THEN
YOU CREATE THIS SUPERVISOR AGENT

AND IT KIND OF ACTS LIKE THE
THINK ABOUT IT AS ACTING AS THE

BRAIN FOR YOUR COMPLEX WORKFLOW.
IT CONFIGURES WHICH AGENTS HAVE

ACCESS TO CONFIDENTIAL
INFORMATION. IT CAN DETERMINE IF

A TASK NEED TO BE FIRED OFF
SEQUENTIALLY, OR IF THEY CAN BE

DONE IN PARALLEL. IF MULTIPLE
AGENTS COME BACK WITH

INFORMATION, IT CAN ACTUALLY
BREAK TIES BETWEEN THE MULTIPLE

OF THEM AND SEND THEM OFF TO DO
DIFFERENT TASKS. IT ENSURES ALL

THIS COLLABORATION AGAINST ALL
YOUR SPECIALIZED AGENTS. LET'S

TAKE AN EXAMPLE. WE ACTUALLY
WORKED WITH MOODY'S TO USE AN

EARLY BETA VERSION OF THIS.
THEIR MOODY'S IS A IS A LEADING

PROVIDER OF FINANCIAL ANALYSTS
ANALYSIS AND RISK MANAGEMENT

SERVICES. AND WHEN THEY WERE
TESTING THIS MULTI-AGENT

COLLABORATION AND BEDROCK, THEY
USED IT TO DELIVER A PROOF OF

CONCEPT FOR AN TO APPLICATION
VERY SIMILAR TO OUR COFFEE CHAIN

EXAMPLE, AN APPLICATION THAT
COULD GENERATE COMPREHENSIVE

FINANCIAL RISK REPORTS FOR THEIR
CUSTOMERS. NOW IT TURNS OUT THAT

BEFORE THIS PROOF OF CONCEPT,
THIS IS A WORKFLOW THAT WOULD

TAKE ONE OF THEIR AGENTS OR ONE
OF THEIR EMPLOYEES ABOUT A WEEK

TO DO TO DO ONE OF THESE, THEY
RAN THIS PROOF OF CONCEPT WITH

THIS MULTI-AGENT COLLABORATION,
THEY WERE ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH THE

SAME TASK IN ONE HOUR, AND THE
ABILITY TO SEAMLESSLY SCALE IT

ACROSS ANY NUMBER OF COMPANIES
IN PARALLEL. THAT IS A FANTASTIC

EFFICIENCY GAIN. BEDROCK TAKES
WHAT WAS GOING TO BE AN ALMOST

IMPOSSIBLE COORDINATION
ENGINEERING TASK, AND MAKES IT

SIMPLE TO DO, AND THAT'S WHAT
WE'RE DOING. LOOK, WE ARE STILL

IN THE VERY EARLIEST DAYS OF
GENERATIVE AI, RIGHT? WE'RE

ALREADY STARTING TO SEE SOME
INCREDIBLE EXPERIENCES. WE'VE

SEEN SOME OF THEM HERE TODAY
BUILT USING INFERENCE. AND YOU

SEE THAT THEY'RE BEING BUILT AS
THIS CORE PART OF THESE

APPLICATIONS. AND ALL BEING
POWERED BY BEDROCK AND WHY IT'S

BECAUSE BEDROCK GIVES YOU ALL OF
THE BEST MODELS. IT GIVES YOU

THE RIGHT TOOLS AND
CAPABILITIES, AND MANY OF THESE

CAPABILITIES YOU CANNOT GET
ANYWHERE ELSE. BEDROCK IS THE

ONLY PLACE WHERE YOU CAN GET
THESE GAME CHANGING RESULTS. AND

OF COURSE, EVERYTHING THAT YOU
USE IS BUILT FROM THE GROUND UP

TO HAVE PRIVACY AND SECURITY
BUILT IN. BECAUSE REMEMBER, YOUR

DATA AND YOUR IP IS REALLY
WHAT'S DIFFERENTIATING. AND SO

IT'S SUPER CRITICAL TO KEEP THAT
SECURE AND THAT ACCESS PRIVATE.

AND THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS
THAT BEDROCK WAS BUILT TO

SUPPORT FROM THE GROUND UP FROM
DAY ONE. AND WE'RE NOT DONE. I

WILL TELL YOU, THIS IS JUST A
SAMPLING OF THE NEW CAPABILITIES

THAT WE'RE ANNOUNCING THIS WEEK.
ONE OF THE HARDEST PARTS TO PUT

IN THIS KEYNOTE TOGETHER WAS
FIGURING OUT WHICH OF THE NUMBER

OF BEDROCK ANNOUNCEMENTS THAT I
WAS GOING TO BE ABLE TO FIT IN.

FORTUNATELY, SWAMI IS GOING TO
BE TALKING ABOUT A TON MORE

DURING HIS KEYNOTE, AND SO I
ENCOURAGE YOU TO CHECK IT OUT

TOMORROW. ALL RIGHT. CUSTOMERS
AROUND THE WORLD ARE TAKING

ADVANTAGE OF AWS TO BUILD
INCREDIBLE THINGS WITH INFERENCE

AS THIS CORE NEW BUILDING BLOCK.
BUT I WILL TELL YOU, THERE IS

ONE COMPANY WHO PROBABLY TAKES
MORE ADVANTAGE OF AWS BUILDING

BLOCKS THAN ANYONE ELSE, AND
THAT'S AMAZON AWS HAS BEEN A

CRITICAL PART OF ALLOWING AMAZON
TO INNOVATE AND SCALE OVER THE

YEARS. NOW, TO TALK MORE ABOUT
THAT, I'M EXCITED TO RE WELCOME

TO THE AWS KEYNOTE STAGE, A GOOD
FRIEND, THE ORIGINAL GODFATHER

OF CLOUD COMPUTING, AND AMAZON
CEO ANDY JASSY.

[APPLAUSE]
[MUSIC]

[APPLAUSE]
[MUSIC]

THANK YOU MATT. IT IS GREAT TO
BE BACK WITH ALL OF YOU. THANK

YOU FOR HAVING ME. SO I'M GOING
TO SHARE A LITTLE BIT ABOUT HOW

WE'RE THINKING ABOUT AI ACROSS
AMAZON. WE HAVE BEEN USING AI

EXPANSIVELY ACROSS THE COMPANY
FOR THE LAST 25 YEARS, BUT THE

WAY THAT WE THINK ABOUT
TECHNOLOGY AND THIS GOES FOR AI

AS WELL, IS THAT WE'RE NOT USING
IT BECAUSE WE THINK IT'S COOL,

WE'RE USING IT BECAUSE WE'RE
TRYING TO SOLVE CUSTOMER

PROBLEMS. AND THAT'S WHY WHEN WE
TALK ABOUT AI, IT'S TYPICALLY

LESS TO ANNOUNCE THAT WE BEAT
THE BEST WORLD CLASS CHESS

PLAYER IN THE WORLD. AND MORE TO
ALLOW YOU TO HAVE BETTER

RECOMMENDATIONS AND PERSONALIZED
RECOMMENDATIONS IN OUR RETAIL

BUSINESS OR TO EQUIP OUR PICKERS
AND OUR FULFILLMENT CENTERS WITH

THE OPTIMAL PATH SO WE CAN GET
ITEMS TO YOU FASTER, OR TO PUT

IT IN OUR PRIME AIR DRONES,
WHERE WE HOPE TO DELIVER ITEMS

TO YOU IN LESS THAN AN HOUR. IN
A COUPLE OF YEARS, OR FOR OUR

JUST WALK OUT TECHNOLOGY AND OUR
AMAZON GO STORES, OR TO FUEL

ALEXA, OR TO PROVIDE YOU THE 25
PLUS AWS AI SERVICES SO YOU CAN

BUILD GREAT APPLICATIONS ON TOP
OF OUR SERVICES. WE PRIORITIZE

TECHNOLOGY THAT WE THINK IS
GOING TO REALLY MATTER FOR

CUSTOMERS. AND WITH THE
EXPLOSION OF GENERATIVE AI IN

THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS, WE'VE
TAKEN THAT SAME APPROACH. THERE

IS A TON OF INNOVATION, BUT WHAT
WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS SOLVE

PROBLEMS FOR YOU. WHAT WE THINK
OF AS PRACTICAL AI. AND SO WHAT

HAVE WE SEEN SO FAR? THE MOST
SUCCESS THAT WE'VE SEEN FROM

COMPANIES EVERYWHERE IN THE
WORLD IS IN COST AVOIDANCE AND

PRODUCTIVITY. AND YOU SEE LOTS
OF COMPANIES HAVING GAINS THERE,

BUT YOU ALSO ARE STARTING TO SEE
COMPLETELY REIMAGINED AND

REINVENTED CUSTOMER EXPERIENCES.
AND WE SEE THESE SAME TRENDS

WHEN WE LOOK AT THE APPLICATIONS
THAT WE'RE BUILDING INSIDE OF

AMAZON AROUND GENERATIVE AI. SO
I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU A FEW

EXAMPLES. SO TAKE CUSTOMER
SERVICE. WE HAVE A RETAIL

BUSINESS WITH A FEW HUNDRED
MILLION CUSTOMERS. THEY

OCCASIONALLY NEED TO CONTACT
CUSTOMER SERVICE. THE VAST

MAJORITY OF THEM PREFER TO DO IT
IN A SELF-SERVICE WAY, SO THEY

CAN DO IT QUICKLY AND TAKE CARE
OF IT THEMSELVES. AND WE HAD

BUILT A CHATBOT MANY YEARS AGO,
AND IT OF COURSE USED MACHINE

LEARNING, BUT IT HAD STATIC
DECISION TREES AND THE CUSTOMERS

HAD TO ENDURE A LOT OF WORDS
BEFORE YOU GOT ANSWERS. SO A

COUPLE OF YEARS AGO, WE REBUILT
THIS USING GENERATIVE AI AND SO

NOW IT'S MUCH EASIER FOR
CUSTOMERS. SO IMAGINE I ORDERED

AN ITEM A COUPLE OF DAYS AGO. I
GET ON THE CHATBOT THE NEW

CHATBOT. WE KNOW WHO YOU ARE
THAT YOU ORDERED A COUPLE OF

DAYS AGO, WHAT YOU ORDERED,
WHERE YOU LIVE. AND WE CAN

PREDICT IN THIS MODEL IF YOU'RE
CONTACTING US JUST A COUPLE OF

DAYS LATER, THAT YOU MIGHT BE
CONTACTING US ABOUT A RETURN.

AND SO WHEN YOU START TO TELL US
THAT WE QUICKLY CAN TELL YOU

WHERE THE NEAREST PHYSICAL
LOCATION AT A WHOLE FOODS OR

SOMEWHERE ELSE IS THAT YOU CAN
RETURN THAT ITEM, AND THEN THE

MODEL IS ALSO SMART ENOUGH TO BE
ABLE TO PREDICT WHEN YOU'RE

GETTING FRUSTRATED WITH IT, AND
YOU MIGHT NEED TO BE CONNECTED

TO A HUMAN FOR RESOLUTION. NOW
THIS CHATBOT BEFORE WE

RE-ENGINEERED IT ALREADY HAD
VERY HIGH CUSTOMER SATISFACTION,

BUT SINCE WE ADDED THE
GENERATIVE AI BRAIN TO IT 500

BASIS POINTS, BETTER CUSTOMER
SATISFACTION. THAT'S PRACTICAL.

AI. WE'RE TAKE SELLERS. WE HAVE
ABOUT 2 MILLION SELLERS WHO SELL

IN OUR RETAIL STORE. WORLDWIDE,
IT'S OVER 60% OF THE UNITS THAT

WE NOW SELL. AND THE WAY THEY
GET A PRODUCT ONTO THE WEBSITE

IS THEY HAVE TO FILL OUT THIS
VERY LONG FORM. AND THE REASON

THERE ARE SO MANY FIELDS IS
WE'RE TRYING TO MAKE IT EASY FOR

OUR CUSTOMERS TO NAVIGATE AND
UNDERSTAND WHAT THE PRODUCTS

ARE, BUT IT'S A LOT OF WORK FOR
SELLERS. AND SO WE REBUILT THE

TOOL. WE BASICALLY BUILT A BRAND
NEW TOOL USING GENERATIVE AI

SUCH THAT NOW SELLERS ONLY HAVE
TO ENTER A FEW WORDS, OR THEY

CAN TAKE A PICTURE, OR THEY CAN
POINT TO A URL AND THEN THE TOOL

FILLS IN A LOT OF THOSE
ATTRIBUTES. IT'S MUCH, MUCH

EASIER FOR SELLERS. AND WE HAVE
OVER 500,000 SELLERS NOW USING

OUR GENERATIVE AI TOOLS. OR LOOK
AT INVENTORY MANAGEMENT. SO

THINK ABOUT THE SCALE OF THE
PROBLEM WE HAVE TO SOLVE IN OUR

RETAIL BUSINESS. WE HAVE OVER
1000 DIFFERENT BUILDINGS OR

NODES AS WE CALL THEM. AND
EVERYTHING WE DO IS OPTIMIZED TO

GET THE RIGHT PRODUCT IN A
FULFILLMENT CENTER OR BUILDING

CLOSE TO THE END CUSTOMER TO
SAVE ON TRANSPORTATION TIME,

WHICH MEANS WE GET IT TO YOU
FASTER AND WE DO IT FOR LOWER

COST. AND SO THAT MEANS THAT ANY
ONE POINT WE HAVE TO UNDERSTAND

WHAT'S IN THAT FULFILLMENT
CENTER, WHAT'S THE INVENTORY

LEVELS OF EACH ITEM, WHICH ITEMS
ARE BEING ORDERED, AND AT WHAT

RATE DO WE HAVE MORE CAPACITY IN
THAT FULFILLMENT CENTER? DO WE

NEED TO MOVE INVENTORY AROUND TO
OTHER FULFILLMENT CENTERS TO

BALANCE THE NETWORK? AND SO
WE'VE USED TRANSFORMER MODELS TO

SOLVE THESE PROBLEMS AND MAKE
FORECASTS. AND ALREADY OUR LONG

TERM DEMAND FORECASTING
TRANSFORMER MODELS HAVE IMPROVED

THAT ACCURACY BY 10%. AND THEN
WE'VE ALSO IMPROVED THE REGIONAL

PREDICTION ACCURACY BY OVER 20%.
THOSE ARE BIG GAINS AT OUR

SCALE. OR THINK ABOUT ROBOTICS.
WE HAVE OVER 750,000 ROBOTS

ROAMING OUR VARIOUS FULFILLMENT
CENTERS, AND THEY HAVE ALL SORTS

OF AI IN THEM. BUT I'LL GIVE YOU
THE EXAMPLE OF SPARROW, WHICH IS

A ROBOTIC ARM THAT DOES RE
SORTING. AND SO IF YOU'VE GOT A

CHANCE TO ZOOM OUT OF OUR
FULFILLMENT CENTERS, IT'S REALLY

AN OPERATION THAT'S CONSTANTLY
TAKING ITEMS FROM LOTS OF

DIFFERENT DISPARATE PARTS. AND
AGGREGATING THEM INTO

CONTAINERS. SO WE OPTIMIZE THE
CAPACITY WE HAVE AND THE

CONVEYANCE THAT WE HAVE. AND SO
WHAT SPARROW IS DOING IS IT'S

TAKING ITEMS FROM ONE BIN AND
IT'S AGGREGATING THEM INTO

ANOTHER BIN. AND SO WHAT THE
GENERATIVE AI NEEDS TO DO IN

SPARROW IS IT HAS TO TELL THEM
WHAT'S IN THE FIRST BIN, WHAT

ITEM DO WE WANT THEM TO GO PICK
UP. IT HAS TO DISCERN WHICH ITEM

IS WHICH. IT HAS TO KNOW HOW TO
GRASP THAT ITEM, GIVEN THE SIZE

OF IT AND THE MATERIALS AND THE
FLEXIBILITY OF THAT MATERIAL.

AND THEN IT HAS TO KNOW WHERE IN
THE RECEIVING BIN IT CAN PUT IT,

AND SO THESE ARE THESE ARE ALL
INVENTIONS THAT ARE CRITICAL TO

US CHANGING THE PROCESSING TIME
AND THE COST TO SERVE OUR

CUSTOMERS. SO WE HAVE ABOUT FIVE
OF THESE BRAND NEW ROBOTICS

INVENTIONS THAT WE'VE PULLED
TOGETHER IN OUR SHREVEPORT,

LOUISIANA FULFILLMENT CENTER
JUST A COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO THAT

WE LAUNCHED. AND ALREADY WE'RE
SEEING 25% FASTER PROCESSING

TIMES, AND WE BELIEVE WE'RE
GOING TO HAVE 25% LOWER COST TO

SERVE DURING THE HOLIDAYS
BECAUSE OF THESE AI INVENTIONS

AND OUR ROBOTICS. SO THESE ARE
ALL EXAMPLES INSIDE OF AMAZON OF

COST AVOIDANCE AND PRODUCTIVITY
THAT ARE HAVING A REAL IMPACT.

BUT WE'RE ALSO SEEING ALTOGETHER
BRAND NEW SHOPPING EXPERIENCES

THAT WERE ABLE TO GENERATE AND
INVENT WITH GENERATIVE AI. SO A

FEW EXAMPLES. I'LL START WITH
SOME AGENTS. LET'S START WITH

RUFUS, WHICH IS OUR SHOPPING
AGENT. SO IF YOU'RE GOING TO BUY

AN ITEM AND YOU KNOW WHAT YOU
WANT, I WOULD ARGUE THAT THERE

ISN'T A BETTER EXPERIENCE THAN
ORDERING IT ON AMAZON. HAVING IT

SHIPPED VERY QUICKLY TO YOUR
HOME. HOWEVER, IF YOU DON'T KNOW

WHAT YOU WANT AND YOU'RE TRYING
TO DECIDE, YOU CAN OBVIOUSLY DO

IT AT AMAZON. MANY OF YOU DO.
BLESS YOU AND THANK YOU FOR

DOING THAT. HOWEVER YOU KNOW
IT'S YOU KNOW AND YOU DO IT

THROUGH BROWSE NODES AND YOU DO
IT THROUGH RECOMMENDATIONS THAT

WE MAKE AND YOU DO IT THROUGH
CUSTOMER REVIEWS. BUT THERE'S

SOMETHING NICE WHEN YOU DON'T
KNOW WHAT YOU WANT ABOUT GOING

INTO A PHYSICAL STORE. AND
ASKING A SALESPERSON, YOU KNOW,

TELLING THEM WHAT YOU'RE
THINKING ABOUT AND HAVING THEM

ASK NARROW IN QUESTIONS AND THEN
POINTING YOU TO MAYBE THE COUPLE

ITEMS THAT THAT YOU WANT TO
CONSIDER. AND THEN YOU LOOK AT

THOSE ITEMS AND YOU DON'T HAVE
ALL THE DATA IN FRONT OF YOU,

AND YOU ASK THAT SALESPERSON,
WELL, WHAT ABOUT THIS? WHAT

ABOUT THAT? THEY CAN ANSWER IT
QUICKLY. IF THEY DON'T WALK AWAY

AND THEN, YOU KNOW, YOU HAVE THE
ABILITY TO MAKE THOSE DECISIONS

ON WHAT YOU WANT QUICKLY AND
WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO WITH

RUFUS IS WE'RE TRYING TO MAKE
THAT EXPERIENCE EVEN BETTER. SO

WITH RUFUS, YOU CAN GO TO ANY
PRODUCT DETAIL PAGE, AND INSTEAD

OF GOING THROUGH THE PLETHORA OF
INFORMATION ON THAT DETAIL PAGE,

YOU CAN ASK ANY QUESTION AND
RUFUS WILL ANSWER IT REALLY

QUICKLY. RUFUS WILL MAKE
COMPARISONS FOR YOU ACROSS

PRODUCTS AND CATEGORIES. IT'LL
MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS. YOU CAN

MAKE REALLY. YOU CAN ASK REALLY
BROAD QUESTIONS FOR

RECOMMENDATIONS, AND IT'LL ASK
NARROWING QUESTIONS. SO IT GETS

AT REALLY WHAT YOUR INTENT IS.
IF YOU SAY TO RUFUS, HEY, I WANT

THAT SAME GOLF GLOVE THAT I
ALWAYS GET, CAN YOU FIND THAT

FOR ME? THE ONE I'VE ORDERED.
RUFUS WILL FIND IT FOR YOU. YOU

CAN SAY TO RUFUS, GIVE ME THE
ORDER STATUS OF THE ITEMS THAT

HAVEN'T BEEN DELIVERED YET, AND
YOU'LL GET THAT, TOO. AND ONE OF

THE NICE THINGS ABOUT RUFUS,
RELATIVE TO A PHYSICAL

SALESPERSON IS THAT RUFUS IS NOT
GOING TO TAKE ANOTHER JOB IN

ANOTHER RETAILER, OR IT'S NOT
GOING TO START WORKING IN

ANOTHER PROFESSION. RUFUS IS
GOING TO BE THERE WITH YOU ALL

THIS TIME, GETTING TO KNOW YOUR
INTENT AND YOUR INTERESTS AND

WHAT YOU WANT BETTER AND BETTER.
OR TAKE ANOTHER AGENT AND ALEXA.

SO WHEN WE STARTED ALEXA AND WE
SHARED THAT OUR GOAL AND OUR

MISSION WAS TO BUILD THE WORLD'S
BEST PERSONAL ASSISTANT, A LOT

OF PEOPLE SCOFFED AT THAT, AND
THEY SCOFFED AT IT BECAUSE IT'S

ACTUALLY REALLY BROAD SURFACE
AREA. AND IT'S HARD TO DO. I

THINK WITH THE ADVENT OF LARGE
LANGUAGE MODELS AND GENERATIVE

AI, IT'S QUITE CLEAR THAT THIS
IS GOING TO EXIST. AND I THINK

IF YOU LOOK AT ALEXA, WHICH HAS
500 MILLION ACTIVE NODES BETWEEN

ALL OF THE DEVICES THAT WE'VE
SOLD AND THE WAY PEOPLE USE THIS

FOR ENTERTAINMENT AND SHOPPING
AND INFORMATION AND SMART HOME

OVER 500 MILLION ACTIVE
ENDPOINTS, WE HAVE A REAL CHANCE

WITH ALEXA TO BE THE LEADER
HERE. NOW WE ARE IN THE PROCESS

RIGHT NOW OF REACRCHITECTING
REACRCHITECTING, THE BRAINS OF

ALEXA WITH MULTIPLE FOUNDATION
MODELS. AND IT'S GOING TO NOT

ONLY HELP ALEXA ANSWER YOUR
QUESTIONS, EVEN BETTER, BUT IT'S

GOING TO DO WHAT VERY FEW
GENERATIVE AI APPLICATIONS DO

TODAY, WHICH IS TO UNDERSTAND
AND ANTICIPATE YOUR NEEDS AND

ACTUALLY TAKE ACTION FOR YOU SO
YOU CAN EXPECT TO SEE THIS IN

THE COMING MONTHS. NOW, IN
ADDITION TO AGENTS, THERE'S A

WHOLE BUNCH OF NEW FEATURES THAT
WE'RE ABLE TO BUILD WITH

GENERATIVE AI, WHICH ARE LEADING
TO VERY DIFFERENT CUSTOMER

EXPERIENCES. I'LL GIVE YOU A FEW
OF THESE. THERE'S A FEATURE WE

HAVE CALLED AMAZON LENS. SO
LET'S SAY THAT YOU'RE AT A

FRIEND'S HOUSE AND YOU SEE A
PLANTER THEY HAVE THAT YOU

ADMIRE. BECAUSE THIS HAPPENS TO
ME VERY OFTEN. AND YOU WANT TO

KNOW WHERE THAT PLANTER IS FROM.
AND YOU ASK YOUR FRIEND, AND MY

FRIEND DOESN'T KNOW WHAT YOU CAN
DO TODAY IS YOU CAN PLUG INTO A

SEARCH ENGINE LIKE AMAZON OR
SOMEWHERE ELSE, PLANTER HANGING,

MACRAME. MAYBE YOU'LL GET A
DECENT ANSWER. PROBABLY NOT.

INSTEAD, YOU CAN USE AMAZON LENS
AND YOU CAN TAKE A PICTURE OF

THAT ITEM. AND WHAT AMAZON LENS
IS DOING IS IT'S USING COMPUTER

VISION. AND THEN A MULTIMODAL
MODEL UNDERNEATH IT TO DO A

SEARCH QUERY THAT LEADS YOU
RIGHT TO THE RIGHT SEARCH RESULT

IN AMAZON WHERE YOU CAN BUY IT
EASILY. IT'S REALLY MAGICAL AND

COOL. OR TAKE SIZING. WE'VE ALL
HAD THIS EXPERIENCE WHERE, YOU

KNOW, WE'RE BUYING A SHIRT AND
YOU DON'T REALLY KNOW IF THAT

BRAND RUNS LARGE OR SMALL,
WHETHER YOU'D BE A MEDIUM OR

LARGE IN THAT SHIRT. WHAT WE'VE
DONE IS WE'VE BUILT A LARGE

LANGUAGE MODEL THAT TAKES ALL
THE SIZING RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN

THE MANY, MANY BRANDS THAT WE
HAVE AND COMPARE WHICH ONES RUN

LIKE EACH OTHER, WHICH RUNS ONES
RUN LARGER OR SMALLER, AND THEN

WE'RE ABLE TO LOOK FOR
CUSTOMERS, WHICH YOU'VE BOUGHT

BEFORE. AND WHEN YOU'RE AT A NEW
BRAND, WE CAN MAKE THE RIGHT

RECOMMENDATION FOR WHAT SIZE YOU
REALLY SHOULD ORDER. VERY HANDY,

VERY PRACTICAL, AND THEN IF YOU
LOOK AT WHAT WE'RE DOING IN

PRIME VIDEO, WE HAVE A VERY DEEP
PARTNERSHIP WITH THE NFL. WE'VE

BUILT SOMETHING TOGETHER OVER
THE YEARS CALLED NEXT GEN STATS,

AND WE COLLECT 500 MILLION DATA
POINTS EVERY SEASON. AND THEN

WE'VE BUILT AI MODELS ON TOP OF
THAT. AND SO YOU CAN SEE SOME OF

THE FEATURES WE'VE BUILT. WE'VE
BUILT SOMETHING CALLED DEFENSIVE

ALERTS, WHICH SHOWS YOU WHICH
DEFENSIVE PLAYER MIGHT BLITZ.

THE QUARTERBACK PUTS A CIRCLE
AROUND IT, CHANGES THE VIEWING

EXPERIENCE. OR WE CAN LOOK AT
DIFFERENT FORMATIONS AND SETS

AND DETECT WHERE THE DEFENSE MAY
BE VULNERABLE. AND SO WE HAVE A

DEFENSIVE VULNERABILITY FEATURE
WHERE WE CAN HIGHLIGHT FOR

VIEWERS WHERE THE OFFENSE SHOULD
ATTACK THESE CHANGE THE

EXPERIENCE FOR FANS. AND SO
THESE ARE BY THE WAY, JUST A FEW

OF THE ALMOST 1000 GENERATIVE AI
APPLICATIONS THAT WE ARE EITHER

BUILDING OR HAVE BUILT INSIDE OF
AMAZON. AND WE HAVE OBVIOUSLY

LEARNED A LOT OF LESSONS ALONG
THE WAY. I THOUGHT I'D JUST

SHARE A FEW OF THOSE WITH YOU.
JUST THREE RIGHT NOW. THE FIRST

IS THAT AS YOU GET TO SCALE IN
GENERATIVE AI APPLICATIONS, THE

COST OF COMPUTE REALLY MATTERS
AND ALL OF OUR GENERATIVE AI

APPLICATIONS AROUND THE WORLD,
ALL OF US, IT'S PRIMARILY BEEN

BUILT WITH ONE CHIP IN THAT
COMPUTE, AND PEOPLE ARE VERY

HUNGRY FOR BETTER PRICE,
PERFORMANCE AND THAT'S WHY

PEOPLE ARE SO EXCITED ABOUT
TRAINIUM TWO. AS MATT WAS

TALKING ABOUT EARLIER, NUMBER
TWO, IT'S ACTUALLY QUITE

DIFFICULT TO BUILD A REALLY GOOD
GENERATIVE AI APPLICATION. IT'S

ABOUT YOU NEED A GOOD MODEL, BUT
IT'S NOT JUST THE MODEL. IN

ADDITION TO THE MODEL, YOU HAVE
TO HAVE THE RIGHT GUARDRAILS AND

YOU HAVE TO HAVE THE RIGHT
FLUENCY OF THE MESSAGING, AND

YOU HAVE TO HAVE THE RIGHT UI,
AND YOU HAVE TO HAVE THE RIGHT

LATENCY, OR IT'S A REALLY SLOW,
LAGGY EXPERIENCE AND YOU HAVE TO

HAVE THE RIGHT COST STRUCTURE.
AND I THINK A LOT OF TIMES WHAT

HAPPENS IS YOU BUILD THESE APPS
IS YOU USE A GREAT MODEL, YOU DO

A LITTLE BIT OF WORK AND YOU
THINK, I HAVE A GREAT GENERATIVE

AI APP AND IT TURNS OUT THAT YOU
REALLY ONLY ABOUT 70% OF THE WAY

THERE. AND THE REALITY IS,
CUSTOMERS DON'T TAKE KINDLY TO

APPS THAT HAVE 30% WONKINESS AND
THEN THE THIRD THING I WOULD SAY

IS THAT I HAVE BEEN SURPRISED
WITH ALL OF THE INTERNAL

BUILDING INSIDE OF AMAZON, WITH
THE DIVERSITY OF THE MODELS

BEING USED, WE GAVE OUR BUILDERS
FREEDOM TO PICK WHAT THEY WANT

TO DO, AND I FIGURED THAT ALMOST
EVERYBODY WOULD END UP USING

ANTHROPIC'S CLAUDE MODELS
BECAUSE THEY'RE THE VERY BEST

PERFORMING MODELS IN THE WORLD
AND HAVE BEEN FOR THE LAST YEAR

OR SO. AND BY THE WAY, WE HAVE A
LOT OF OUR INTERNAL BUILDERS

USING CLAUDE, BUT THEY'RE ALSO
USING LLAMA MODELS AND THEY'RE

ALSO USING THESE MODELS, AND
THEY'RE ALSO USING SOME OF OUR

OWN MODELS, AND THEY'RE ALSO
USING HOMEGROWN MODELS

THEMSELVES. AND SO THIS KIND OF
SURPRISED US. BUT IN SOME WAYS,

AS I THINK ABOUT IT, IT DOESN'T
SURPRISE US BECAUSE WE KEEP

LEARNING THE SAME LESSON OVER
AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN, WHICH

IS THAT THERE IS NEVER GOING TO
BE ONE TOOL TO RULE THE WORLD.

IT'S NOT THE CASE IN DATABASES.
WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THIS

FOR TEN YEARS. PEOPLE USE LOTS
OF DIFFERENT RELATIONAL

DATABASES OR NON-RELATIONAL
DATABASES. IT'S NOT THE CASE IN

ANALYTICS. YOU KNOW, I REMEMBER
6 OR 7 YEARS AGO BEING ON STAGE

AND WE WERE TALKING ABOUT HOW
EVERYBODY THOUGHT THE TENSORFLOW

WAS GOING TO BE THE ONE AI
FRAMEWORK WE KEPT SAYING THEY'RE

GOING TO BE A LOT OF THEM. AND
THERE WERE. AND IT TURNS OUT

THAT PYTORCH ENDED UP BEING THE
MOST POPULAR ONE, AND THE SAME

IS GOING TO BE TRUE FOR MODELS.
AND WE SEE THIS INTERNALLY. WHAT

WE'VE NOTICED AS WE'VE BEEN
BUILDING ALL THESE APPLICATIONS

IS THAT OUR INTERNAL BUILDERS
HAVE BEEN ASKING FOR ALL SORTS

OF THINGS FROM OUR TEAMS THAT
ARE BUILDING MODELS. THEY WANT

BETTER LATENCY, THEY WANT LOWER
COST, THEY WANT THE ABILITY TO

DO FINE TUNING. THEY WANT THE
ABILITY TO BETTER ORCHESTRATE

ACROSS THEIR DIFFERENT KNOWLEDGE
BASES TO BE ABLE TO GROUND THEIR

DATA. THEY WANT TO TAKE LOTS OF
AUTOMATED, ORCHESTRATED ACTIONS,

OR WHAT PEOPLE CALL AGENTIC
BEHAVIOR. THEY WANT A BUNCH,

THEY WANT BETTER IMAGE AND
VIDEO. THEY WANT A WHOLE BUNCH

OF THINGS. AND WE SHARE THAT
FEEDBACK WITH OUR MODEL PROVIDER

PARTNERS. AND THEY'RE VERY
RECEPTIVE, BUT THEY'RE BUSY. I

MEAN, SO YOU GUYS WANT A LOT
THERE'S A LOT TO DO. AND SO IT'S

ONE OF THE REASONS WHY WE HAVE
CONTINUED TO WORK ON OUR OWN

FRONTIER MODELS. AND THOSE
FRONTIER MODELS HAVE MADE A

TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF PROGRESS
OVER THE LAST 4 TO 5 MONTHS. AND

WE FIGURED IF WE WERE FINDING
VALUE OUT OF THEM, YOU WOULD

PROBABLY FIND VALUE OUT OF THEM.
SO I'M EXCITED TO SHARE AND

ANNOUNCE THE LAUNCH OF AMAZON
NOVA, WHICH ARE OUR NEW STATE OF

THE ART FOUNDATION MODELS THAT
DELIVER FRONTIER INTELLIGENCE

AND INDUSTRY LEADING PRICE
PERFORMANCE.

[APPLAUSE]
SO IN THIS INTELLIGENT SET OF

MODELS, THERE ARE FOUR FLAVORS.
THE FIRST IS MICRO, WHICH IS A

TEXT ONLY MODEL, WHICH MEANS YOU
FEED IT TEXT AND IT OUTPUTS

TEXT. IT'S LASER FAST, VERY COST
EFFECTIVE, AND OUR INTERNAL

BUILDERS ARE REALLY ENJOYING IT
FOR A LOT OF THEIR SIMPLE TASKS.

AND THEN WE HAVE THREE FLAVORS
OF MULTIMODAL MODELS. AND SO

MULTIMODAL MODELS YOU YOU CAN
INPUT TEXT OR IMAGE OR VIDEO AND

YOU OUTPUT TEXT. AND SO EACH OF
THESE ARE IN ASCENDING ORDER OF

SIZE. AND INTELLIGENCE. THE
MICRO LITE AND PRO MODELS ARE

GENERALLY AVAILABLE TODAY. THE
PREMIER MODEL WILL BE AVAILABLE

IN THE Q1 TIME FRAME. SO I'M
GOING TO SHARE A FEW BENCHMARKS.

I'LL JUST SAY THAT WE USED
EXTERNAL PUBLISHED BENCHMARKS

WHENEVER WE COULD AND WHEN THEY
WEREN'T AVAILABLE, WE DID IT

OURSELVES. WE PUBLISHED A
METHODOLOGY ON OUR WEBSITE. SO

YOU CAN TRY AND REPLICATE IT IF
YOU LIKE. SO I'LL JUST SHARE

SOME OF THE BENCHMARKS. SO ON
THE MICRO MODEL YOU CAN SEE IT

IS A VERY COMPETITIVE MODEL. WE
IF YOU LOOK AT THE RAW NUMBERS

RELATIVE TO THE LEADING MODELS
IN THIS CLASS, LLAMA AND

GOOGLE'S GEMINI, I THINK ON THE
RAW NUMBERS, IT'S IT BENCHMARKS

BETTER ON ALL THE VARIABLES
VERSUS LLAMA AND 12 OR 13 VERSUS

GEMINI. BUT IF YOU DO
STATISTICAL SIGNIFICANCE

TESTING, WHICH WE DID, WE JUST
TOOK ALL THE NUMBERS THAT WERE

OVERLAPPING IN THE 95%
CONFIDENCE INTERVAL. AND WE

CALLED THOSE EQUAL. SO IF YOU
LOOK AT IT THAT WAY, WHICH I

WILL MOVING FORWARD, YOU CAN SEE
THAT WE ARE EQUAL OR BETTER ON

ALL THE BENCHMARKS COMPARED TO
LLAMA AND GEMINI IN THESE IN

THIS CLASS OF MODELS, IF I LOOK
AT THE LIGHT MODEL, IT'S A VERY

SIMILAR STORY, VERY COMPETITIVE.
IF YOU COMPARE NOVA LIGHT TO

OPENAI'S GPT FOUR MINI, YOU CAN
SEE THAT WE'RE EQUAL OR BETTER

ON 17 OF THE 19 BENCHMARKS EQUAL
OR BETTER ON 17 OF THE 21

BENCHMARKS VERSUS GEMINI, AND
THEN EQUAL OR BETTER ON HAIKU,

3.5 ON TEN OF THE 12 BENCHMARKS.
HAIKU ISN'T DOING IMAGES OR

VIDEO YET, SO WE COULDN'T
BENCHMARK ON AS MANY DIMENSIONS.

BUT AGAIN, A VERY COMPETITIVE
MODEL. AND THEN IF YOU LOOK AT

PRO, SAME STORY, IF YOU COMPARE
IT TO GPT FOUR, OH, IT'S EQUAL

OR BETTER ON 17 OF THE 20
BENCHMARKS, IT'S EQUAL OR BETTER

ON 16 OF THE 21 BENCHMARKS
VERSUS GEMINI, THE VERY BEST

MODEL IN THIS CLASS OF MODELS IS
SONNET V2 3.5. BUT EVEN HERE YOU

CAN SEE THAT OUR PRO MODEL IS
EQUAL OR BETTER ON ABOUT HALF OF

THOSE. AND ON THE ONES THAT ARE
NOT, IT'S VERY COMPETITIVE. AND

YOU'RE GOING TO LIKE THE COST
AND THE LATENCY CHARACTERISTICS

HERE. AND THEN OUR PREMIERE
MODEL, WHICH WILL BE OUR LARGEST

MULTIMODAL MODEL, WILL BE
AVAILABLE IN THE Q1 TIME FRAME

NOW. SO THAT'S FOR VERY
COMPETITIVE, COMPELLING

INTELLIGENCE MODELS. BUT THERE
ARE SOME OTHER THINGS THAT I

THINK ARE GOING TO REALLY LIKE
ABOUT THESE MODELS. FIRST,

THEY'RE REALLY COST EFFECTIVE.
THEY'RE ABOUT 75% LESS EXPENSIVE

THAN THE OTHER LEADING MODELS IN
BEDROCK TWO. THEY ARE FAST.

THEY'RE THE FASTEST MODELS THAT
YOU'LL SEE WITH WITH RESPECT TO

LATENCY. WE'LL ALSO MAKE THE
NOVA MODELS AVAILABLE IN THE SKU

THAT PETER WAS TALKING ABOUT
LAST NIGHT. AND THE LATENCY

OPTIMIZED INFERENCE SKEW AS
WELL, THE VERY FAST. AND THEN

THEY'RE NOT JUST INTEGRATED,
THEY'RE JUST NOT IN BEDROCK, BUT

THEY'RE INTEGRATED DEEPLY WITH
ALL THE FEATURES AND BEDROCK

THAT ANY MODEL PROVIDER CAN USE.
IT'S JUST THAT THIS TEAM TOOK

THE TIME TO DO THEM. AND SO THAT
MEANS THAT YOU GET FINE TUNING

INCREASINGLY A LOT OF OUR APP
BUILDERS FOR GENERATIVE AI, THEY

WANT TO DO FINE TUNING WITH
LABELED EXAMPLES TO MAKE THE

APPLICATIONS PERFORM BETTER.
YOU'LL ALSO BE THE NOVA MODELS

ARE ALSO INTEGRATED WITH THE
DISTILLATION FEATURE. THE

MATTRESS TALKED ABOUT, SO YOU
CAN INFUSE INTELLIGENCE OF

BIGGER MODELS INTO SMALLER
MODELS THAT ARE MORE COST

EFFECTIVE AND LOWER LATENCY.
IT'S DEEPLY INTEGRATED IN

BEDROCK KNOWLEDGE BASES SO THAT
YOU CAN USE RAG TO GROUND YOUR

ANSWERS IN YOUR OWN DATA. AND
THEN ALSO WE HAVE OPTIMIZED

THESE MODELS TO WORK WITH THE
PROPRIETARY SYSTEMS AND APIS SO

THAT YOU CAN ACTUALLY DO
MULTIPLE ORCHESTRATED AUTOMATIC

STEPS AGENTIC BEHAVIOR MUCH MORE
EASILY WITH THESE MODELS. SO I

THINK THESE ARE VERY COMPELLING.
I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO TAKING A

SHOT AT THEM AND USING THEM NOW.
CUSTOMERS WANT TO ACTUALLY DO

MORE AROUND GENERATIVE AI THAN
JUST WITH OUTPUTS THAT ARE TEXT.

THEY ALSO HAVE A LOT OF NEEDS
AROUND IMAGES AND AROUND VIDEO,

AND THERE'S LOTS OF EXAMPLES OF
IT, BUT SIMPLE ONES ARE

ADVERTISING OR MARKETING OR
TRADING MATERIALS AND SO WE'VE

WORKED HARD, YOU KNOW, IT'S
EXPENSIVE. THERE AREN'T A LOT OF

OPTIONS OUT HERE. THEY'RE NOT
EASY TO DO YOURSELF. AND WE'VE

WORKED HARD ON THIS PROBLEM. AND
I'M EXCITED TO ANNOUNCE TWO MORE

MODELS FOR YOU. FIRST IS AMAZON
NOVA CANVAS, WHICH IS OUR STATE

OF THE ART IMAGE GENERATION
MODEL.

[APPLAUSE]
AND SO CANVAS, IT ALLOWS YOU TO

IMPORT NATURAL LANGUAGE TEXT,
GET IMAGES BACK IN. THEY'RE

BEAUTIFUL IMAGES. THEY'RE STUDIO
QUALITY IMAGES.

IT ALLOWS YOU TO EDIT
IMAGES USING NATURAL LANGUAGE OR

TEXT INPUTS. IT GIVES YOU
CONTROLS FOR COLOR SCHEME AND

LAYOUT. IT HAS A NUMBER OF BUILT
IN CONTROLS FOR RESPONSIBLE USE

OF AI, INCLUDING WATERMARKING
FOR TRACEABILITY, AS WELL AS

OF AI, INCLUDING WATERMARKING
FOR TRACEABILITY, AS WELL AS

CONTENT MODERATION 
TO LIMIT THE GENERATION OF

HARMFUL CONTENT. AND WE
BENCHMARK THIS AS WELL. WE TRIED

TO BENCHMARK IT VERSUS SOME OF
THE OTHER STATE OF THE ART

PLAYERS IN THIS SPACE. IN THIS
CASE, WE PICK, YOU KNOW,

TYPICALLY WHAT PEOPLE CONSIDER
THE TWO LEADERS HERE, WHICH ARE

YOU'LL SEE DALL-E THREE AND
STABLE DIFFUSION 3.5. AND WE

BENCHMARKED ON THE TWO VARIABLES
THAT MATTER MOST, WHICH IS IMAGE

QUALITY AND INSTRUCTION
FOLLOWING. AND YOU CAN SEE THAT

CANVAS OUTPERFORMS BOTH OF THEM
ON BOTH OF THOSE DIMENSIONS. WE

ALSO DID A HUMAN EVALUATION
WHERE YOU SAW SIMILAR TYPES OF

RESULTS. SO THIS IS A COMPELLING
MODEL. AND THEN OF COURSE WE

ALSO WANT TO ALLOW YOU
TO HAVE IT BE EASY TO GENERATE

VIDEO. AND SO WE'RE EXCITED TO
ANNOUNCE THE LAUNCH OF AMAZON

NOVA REEL, WHICH IS OUR STATE OF
THE ART VIDEO GENERATION MODEL.

[APPLAUSE]
SO AGAIN, WITH REAL, IT'S STUDIO

QUALITY VIDEO. IT'S REALLY
STUNNING VIDEOS THAT YOU CAN

CREATE. IT GIVES YOU FULL
CONTROL OF THE CAMERA, LETS YOU

HAVE MOTION CONTROL. IT LETS YOU
DO PANNING. IT LETS YOU DO 360

DEGREE ROTATION AND ZOOM. IT
ALSO HAS BUILT IN AI CONTROLS

FOR SAFE AI, INCLUDING
WATERMARKING AND CONTENT

MODERATION. WE'LL LAUNCH IT WITH
THE ABILITY TO DO SIX SECOND

VIDEOS, WHICH WORKS REALLY WELL
FOR A LOT OF MARKETING AND

ADVERTISING ON ITS WAY UP TO TWO
MINUTE VIDEOS IN THE NEXT FEW

MONTHS. WE BENCHMARK THIS AS
WELL. THERE AREN'T REALLY MANY

VIDEO GENERATION SERVICES THAT
HAVE AN API, AND THEN NONE OF

THEM HAVE AUTOMATED
BENCHMARKS. SO WE JUST TOOK ONE

OF THE WE BENCHMARKED WITH HUMAN
EVALUATION VERSUS ONE OF THE

LEADERS HERE IN RUNWAY. AND YOU
CAN SEE AGAIN THAT REAL

BENCHMARKS VERY FAVORABLY
RELATIVE TO OTHERS. SO THAT'S

SIX NEW FRONTIER MODELS FOR YOU.
WHAT'S GOING TO BE NEXT FOR US

IN NOVA? WELL, THE FIRST THING
IS THE TEAM IS GOING TO BE

WORKING REALLY HARD OVER THE
NEXT YEAR. ON THE SECOND

GENERATION OF THESE MODELS. BUT
I ALSO HAVE A COUPLE OF THINGS

THAT I THOUGHT I'D GIVE YOU A
SNEAK PEEK INTO. THE FIRST IS

THAT IN THE Q1 TIME FRAME, WE
ANTICIPATE GIVING YOU A SPEECH

TO SPEECH MODEL, WHICH WILL
ALLOW YOU TO INPUT SPEECH AND

GET SPEECH BACK VERY FLUENT,
VERY FAST.

[APPLAUSE]
AND THEN AROUND MID-YEAR, WE'RE

GOING TO GIVE YOU AN ANY TO ANY
MODEL. SO THIS IS REALLY

MULTIMODAL TO MULTIMODAL.
[APPLAUSE]

SO YOU'LL BE ABLE TO INPUT TEXT
SPEECH IMAGES OR VIDEO AND

OUTPUT TEXT SPEECH IMAGES AND
VIDEO. THIS IS THE FUTURE OF HOW

FRONTIER MODELS ARE GOING TO BE
BUILT AND CONSUMED. AND WE'RE

REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO GIVING
THIS TO YOU. SO YOU MAY BE

ASKING YOURSELF, HOW SHOULD I
THINK ABOUT AWS'S MODEL

STRATEGY? THEY HAVE VERY DEEP
PARTNERSHIPS WITH A NUMBER OF

MODEL PROVIDERS. THEY HAVE SOME
OF THEIR OWN MODELS NOW. AND THE

WAY I WOULD TELL YOU TO THINK
ABOUT IT IS THE WAY THAT WE

ALWAYS PROVIDE YOU SELECTION IN
EVERYTHING WE DO, WHICH IS THAT

WE ARE GOING TO GIVE YOU THE
BROADEST AND BEST FUNCTIONALITY

YOU CAN FIND ANYWHERE. AND WHAT
THAT'S GOING TO MEAN IS IT'S

GOING TO MEAN CHOICE. THE
REALITY IS THAT ALL OF YOU ARE

GOING TO USE DIFFERENT MODELS
FOR DIFFERENT REASONS AT

DIFFERENT TIMES, WHICH BY THE
WAY, IS THE WAY THE REAL WORLD

WORKS. THE HUMAN BEINGS DON'T GO
TO ONE HUMAN BEING FOR EXPERTISE

IN EVERY SINGLE AREA. YOU HAVE
DIFFERENT HUMAN BEINGS WHO ARE

GREAT AT DIFFERENT THINGS.
YOU'RE GOING TO SOMETIMES BE

OPTIMIZING FOR CODING, SOMETIMES
FOR MATH, SOMETIMES FOR

INTEGRATION WITH RAG, SOMETIMES
FOR AGENTIC NEEDS, SOMETIMES FOR

LOWER LATENCY, SOMETIMES FOR
COST, MOST OF THE TIME, FOR SOME

COMBINATION OF THESE, AND AT
AWS, WE ARE GOING TO GIVE YOU

THE VERY BEST COMBINATION OF ALL
OF THESE. AS WE ALWAYS DO, AND

WE THINK WE'VE ADDED SOME PRETTY
INTERESTING MODELS TO THE MIX

TODAY. BUT THE GREAT THING IS,
IS THAT ALL OF THESE MODELS ARE

AVAILABLE FOR YOU IN BEDROCK,
AND YOU CAN USE THEM IN WHATEVER

COMBINATION YOU WANT, AND YOU
CAN EXPERIMENT AND YOU CAN

CHANGE OVER TIME. AND WE WILL
GIVE YOU THAT SELECTION AND THAT

CHOICE TODAY, AS WELL AS IN THE
FUTURE. SO WITH THAT, I WILL SAY

HAVE AT IT. GIDDY UP AND BACK TO
MATT. THANK YOU.

[MUSIC]
[MUSIC]

THAT WAS AWESOME. THANK YOU
ANDY. IT'S SO FUN TO HAVE HIM

BACK AT RE:INVENT. THANKS SO
MUCH. AND IT WAS IT'S FUN TO

SHARE A NUMBER OF THE THINGS
THAT AMAZON IS DOING, BUT ALSO

ABOUT THE NOVA MODELS. AND I'M
SURE MANY OF YOU ARE EXCITED TO

GET OUT THERE AND TRY MANY OF
THOSE NOVA MODELS. ALL RIGHT.

OUR GOAL IN IN AWS IS TO HELP
EVERY BUILDER BE ABLE TO

INNOVATE. WE WANT TO FREE YOU
FROM THE UNDIFFERENTIATED HEAVY

LIFTING TO REALLY FOCUS ON THOSE
CREATIVE THINGS THAT MAKE WHAT

YOU'RE BUILDING THE MOST UNIQUE,
NOW, GENERATIVE AI IS A HUGE

ACCELERATOR OF THIS CAPABILITY.
IT ALLOWS YOU TO FOCUS ON THOSE

PIECES AND PUSH OFF SOME OF THAT
UNDIFFERENTIATED HEAVY LIFTING.

NOW, HOW MANY DEVELOPERS DO WE
HAVE OUT THERE IN THE AUDIENCE?

SHOW OF HANDS. WE'VE GOT SOME
DEVELOPERS OUT THERE. EXCELLENT.

I KNOW WE HAVE A BUNCH OF
DEVELOPERS HERE TODAY, SO I

THOUGHT I'D SPEND A COUPLE OF
MINUTES TALKING ABOUT HOW WE

MAKE HELP MAKE DEVELOPERS MORE
EFFICIENT. LAST YEAR WE

INTRODUCED AMAZON Q DEVELOPER,
WHICH IS YOUR AWS EXPERT, AND

IT'S THE MOST CAPABLE GENERATIVE
AI ASSISTANT FOR SOFTWARE

DEVELOPMENT. NOW, CUSTOMERS LIKE
DAVE CHAPPELLE HAVE ACHIEVED UP

TO 70% EFFICIENCY IMPROVEMENTS
BY USING Q DEVELOPER. THEY

REDUCE THEIR TIME TO DEPLOY NEW
FEATURES. THEY COMPLETED TASKS

FASTER, AND THEY MINIMIZED A
BUNCH OF REPETITIVE ACTIONS. BUT

IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT EFFICIENCY.
FINRA, AS AN EXAMPLE, HAS

WITNESSED A REMARKABLE 20% BOOST
IN THE CODE QUALITY AND

INTEGRITY BY USING Q DEVELOPER,
HELPING THEM CREATE BETTER

PERFORMING, AND MORE SECURE
SOFTWARE. NOW, WHEN WE FIRST

LAUNCHED, OUR GOAL WAS TO
DELIVER A GREAT CODING ASSISTANT

WITH Q DEVELOPER, AND WE DID
JUST THAT. IN FACT, Q HAS THE

HIGHEST REPORTED ACCEPTANCE RATE
OF ANY MULTI-LINE CODING

ASSISTANT OUT THERE IN THE
MARKET TODAY. BUT IT TURNS OUT

THAT A CODING ASSISTANT IS JUST
REALLY A SMALL PART OF WHAT MOST

DEVELOPERS NEED. THROUGHOUT YOUR
DAY, WE TALKED TO DEVELOPERS,

AND IN FACT, IT TURNS OUT MOST
DEVELOPERS SPEND AN AVERAGE OF

JUST ONE HOUR A DAY CODING.
THAT'S IT. THE REST OF THE TIME

THEY SPEND ON OTHER END TO END
DEVELOPMENT TASKS. SO WE THOUGHT

WE'D LOOK AT THAT FULL CYCLE TO
SEE IF THERE'S ANYWHERE ELSE

THAT WE COULD HELP. AND IT TURNS
OUT THERE'S A BUNCH OF TASKS

THAT TAKE UP DEVELOPER TIME, BUT
THEY'RE PART OF THE JOBS THAT

MOST DEVELOPERS DON'T REALLY
LOVE DOING RIGHT? THINGS LIKE

WRITING UNIT TESTS OR MANAGING
CODE REVIEWS. AND LOOK, I USED

TO RUN A LARGE DEVELOPMENT TEAM.
I'M PRETTY SURE I NEVER MET A

DEVELOPER WHO LOVED SPENDING
THEIR TIME WRITING GREAT

DOCUMENTATION FOR THEIR CODE,
BUT IT IS IMPORTANT. IT'S NOT

SUPER ENGAGING, BUT IT IS
ACTUALLY REALLY IMPORTANT. IT'S

TEDIOUS. IT'S TIME CONSUMING,
BUT IT'S CRITICAL. AND IT'S ONE

OF THOSE THINGS YOU DON'T WANT
TO SKIP, UNFORTUNATELY, BECAUSE

IT'S NOT THAT FUN. SOMETIMES
PEOPLE PAPER IT OVER AND DON'T

DO A GREAT JOB. SO TODAY I'M
REALLY EXCITED TO ANNOUNCE THREE

NEW AUTONOMOUS AGENTS AS PART OF
Q DEVELOPER THAT CAN HELP

ANNOUNCING Q AUTONOMOUS AGENTS
FOR GENERATING UNIT TESTS,

DOCUMENTATION, AND CODE REVIEWS.
[APPLAUSE]

Q CAN NOW AUTOMATICALLY GENERATE
END TO END USER TESTS. YOU JUST

TYPE IN SLASH TEST AND Q USES
ADVANCED AGENTS AS WELL AS

KNOWLEDGE OF YOUR ENTIRE PROJECT
TO CREATE FULL TEST COVERAGE FOR

YOU. THEIR SECOND AGENT CAN
AUTOMATICALLY CREATE ACCURATE

DOCUMENTATION FOR YOU. IT CAN.
THE INTERESTING THING IS IT'S

NOT JUST NEW CODE. THE Q AGENT
CAN ACTUALLY APPLY TO LEGACY

CODE AS WELL. SO IF YOU COME
ACROSS A CODE BASE THAT MAYBE

WASN'T PERFECTLY DOCUMENTED BY
ONE OF YOUR COWORKERS. Q CAN

HELP YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT THAT
CODE IS DOING AS WELL. YOU CAN

NOW USE CODE TO AUTOMATICALLY DO
CODE REVIEWS FOR YOU. IT'LL SCAN

FOR VULNERABILITIES, FLAG
SUSPICIOUS CODING PATTERNS, EVEN

IDENTIFY POTENTIAL OPEN SOURCE
PACKAGE RISKS THAT YOU MIGHT

HAVE. ACTUALLY, ONE OF THE OTHER
COOL THINGS IT DOES IS IT'LL

EVEN IDENTIFY WHERE IT VIEWS A
DEPLOYMENT RISK AND SUGGEST

MITIGATIONS FOR YOU OF HOW YOU
CAN MAKE A SAFER DEPLOYMENT. WE

THINK THAT THESE AGENTS CAN
MATERIALLY REDUCE A LOT OF THE

TIME THAT'S SPENT ON THESE
REALLY IMPORTANT, BUT MAYBE

UNDIFFERENTIATED TASKS AND ALLOW
YOUR DEVELOPERS TO SPEND MORE

TIME ON THOSE VALUE ADDED
ACTIVITIES. BUT AGAIN, IT'S NOT

JUST CAPABILITIES. IT ALSO
MATTERS WHERE YOU ACCESS Q YOU

WANT Q TO BE AVAILABLE WHERE YOU
NEED IT. AND SO WE'VE ADDED Q IN

THE CONSOLE. WE HAVE Q AVAILABLE
IN SLACK AND IT'S AVAILABLE ON

ALL THE POPULAR IDES LIKE VISUAL
STUDIO VSCODE, INTELLIJ AND

STARTING TODAY I'M EXCITED TO
ANNOUNCE A NEW DEEP INTEGRATION

BETWEEN Q DEVELOPER AND GITLAB.
[APPLAUSE]

WITH THIS NEW PARTNERSHIP, Q
DEVELOPER FUNCTIONALITY IS

DEEPLY EMBEDDED IN Q'S. IN
GITLAB'S POPULAR PLATFORM. IT'S

GOING TO HELP POWER MANY OF THE
POPULAR ASPECTS OF THEIR DUO

ASSISTANT. NOW YOU'RE GOING TO
BE ABLE TO ACCESS Q DEVELOPER

CAPABILITIES, AND THEY'RE GOING
TO BE NATIVELY AVAILABLE IN THE

GITLAB WORKFLOWS. AND WE'RE
GOING TO BE ADDING MORE AND MORE

OVER TIME. WE TRIALED THIS
CONCEPT WITH A COUPLE OF EARLY

CUSTOMERS LIKE SOUTHWEST
AIRLINES AND MERCEDES-BENZ, AND

THEY TOLD US THAT THEY WERE
INCREDIBLY EXCITED TO TAKE

ADVANTAGE OF THE COMBINATION OF
AMAZON, Q DEVELOPER AND GITLAB

TOGETHER. NOW, IF WE WANT TO
HELP WITH THE FULL DEVELOPER

LIFECYCLE, THOUGH, YOU CAN'T
JUST STOP WITH NEW APPLICATIONS.

AS MANY OF YOU KNOW, A LOT OF
DEVELOPMENT TIME IS NOT SPENT ON

NEW APPLICATIONS, BUT IT'S
DEALING WITH MANAGING EXISTING

APPLICATIONS. ACTUALLY, A TON OF
DEVELOPER TIME IS SPENT

MAINTAINING MODERNIZING,
PATCHING EXISTING APPLICATIONS,

AND THESE TAKE A LOT OF EFFORT
IN FACT, WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT

LEGACY APPLICATION UPGRADES AS
AN EXAMPLE, THOSE ARE HUGE

MULTI-MONTH EFFORTS AND A LOT OF
TIMES THEY'RE SUPER COMPLICATED

AND CAN BE REALLY LONG. ONE OF Q
DEVELOPERS MOST POWERFUL

CAPABILITIES WE ALREADY HAVE IS
AUTOMATING JAVA VERSION

UPGRADES. WHAT IT CAN DO IS IT
CAN TRANSFORM A JAVA APPLICATION

FROM AN OLD VERSION OF JAVA TO A
NEW VERSION IN A FRACTION OF THE

TIME IT WOULD TAKE TO DO
MANUALLY. THIS IS WORK THAT NO

DEVELOPER LOVES TO DO, BUT IS
CRITICALLY IMPORTANT. EARLIER

THIS YEAR, AMAZON INTEGRATED
THIS CAPABILITY INTO OUR OWN

INTERNAL SYSTEMS WHERE WE HAVE A
LOT OF OLDER, OLDER JAVA CODE

THAT NEEDED TO BE UPGRADED USING
Q DEV. WE MIGRATED LITERALLY

TENS OF THOUSANDS OF PRODUCTION
APPLICATIONS UP TO JAVA 17, AND

WE DID IT IN A SMALL FRACTION OF
THE TIME. THE ESTIMATE BY THE

TEAMS IS THIS SAVED US 4500
DEVELOPER YEARS. THIS IS LIKE A

MIND BLOWING AMOUNT OF TIME THAT
WAS SAVED BY UPGRADING AND

BECAUSE WE'RE NOW RUNNING ON
MODERN JAVA APPLICATIONS, WE

ACTUALLY CAN USE LESS HARDWARE
TOO. AND SO WE ACTUALLY SAVED

$260 MILLION A YEAR THROUGH THIS
PROCESS. THIS GOT US THINKING,

THAT IS FANTASTIC. I WONDER WHAT
ELSE CAN HELP US TRANSFORM. I

ACTUALLY LOVE ASKING CUSTOMERS
HOW WE CAN HELP THEM AND WHAT

THEIR BIGGEST PAIN POINTS ARE. I
THINK YOU HEAR SOME INTERESTING

THINGS COMING OUT OF THAT, AND
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WILL

QUICKLY BUBBLE TO THE TOP IS
WINDOWS. CUSTOMERS WOULD LOVE AN

EASY BUTTON TO GET OFF OF
WINDOWS. THEY'RE TIRED OF

CONSTANT SECURITY ISSUES, THE
CONSTANT PACKING OR PATCHING,

ALL THE SCALABILITY CHALLENGES
THAT THEY HAVE TO DEAL WITH, AND

THEY DEFINITELY HATE THE ONEROUS
LICENSING COSTS. BUT WE DO

RECOGNIZE TODAY THAT THIS IS
HARD, ACTUALLY MODERNIZING AWAY

FROM WINDOWS IS NOT EASY TODAY,
SO I'M HAPPY TO ANNOUNCE Q

TRANSFORMATION FOR WINDOWS .NET
APPLICATIONS.

[APPLAUSE]
NOW WITH Q DEVELOPER MODERNIZING

WINDOWS JUST GOT A LOT EASIER. Q
DEVELOPER HELPS YOU TRANSFORM.

NET APPLICATIONS THAT ARE
RUNNING ON WINDOWS TO LINUX IN A

FRACTION OF THE TIME. WHAT
HAPPENS IS Q DEV LAUNCHES AGENTS

THAT CAN AUTOMATICALLY DISCOVER
INCOMPATIBILITIES, GENERATE A

TRANSFORMATION PLAN, AND
REFACTOR YOUR SOURCE CODE. AND

IT CAN DO THIS ACROSS HUNDREDS
OR EVEN THOUSANDS OF

APPLICATIONS IN PARALLEL. IT
TURNS OUT Q DEV CAN HELP YOU

MODERNIZE. NET APPLICATIONS FOR
X FASTER THAN DOING IT MANUALLY.

AND ONCE YOU'RE DONE, THE GOOD
NEWS IS YOU SAVE 40% BY SAVING

ALL YOUR LICENSING COSTS. ONE
CUSTOMER SIGNATURE IT IS A

EUROPEAN LEADER IN DIGITAL
TRANSACTIONS AND THEY'RE REALLY

FOCUSED ON MODERNIZING THEIR
LEGACY. NET APPLICATIONS AWAY

FROM WINDOWS AND THEY REALLY
WANTED TO MOVE THAT FROM WINDOWS

TO LINUX. WE WORKED WITH THEM ON
AN EARLY BETA OF Q DEVELOPER AND

WHAT IT WAS A PROJECT THAT THEY
ESTIMATED WAS GOING TO TAKE 6 TO

8 MONTHS. THEY ACTUALLY
COMPLETED IN JUST A FEW DAYS.

THAT IS A GAME CHANGING AMOUNT
OF TIME. FANTASTIC. BUT IT TURNS

OUT WINDOWS IS NOT THE ONLY
LEGACY PLATFORM IN A DATA CENTER

THAT'S SLOWING DOWN ALL YOUR
MODERNIZATION EFFORTS. ACTUALLY,

MORE AND MORE, AS WE TALK TO
CUSTOMERS, THEY'RE REALLY

WANTING TO GET OUT OF DATA
CENTERS ENTIRELY. CUSTOMERS LIKE

ITAU UNIBANCO AND EXPERIAN AND
BOOKING.COM AND REALLY THOUSANDS

MORE OF THEM HAVE PARTNERED WITH
US TO FULLY EXIT OUT OF THEIR

DATA CENTERS, LOWER THEIR COSTS
AND JUST FOCUS THEIR TEAMS ON

INNOVATION AS OPPOSED TO RUNNING
INFRASTRUCTURE. IT'S COOL TO SEE

THESE FULL DATA CENTER
MIGRATIONS, BUT WE KNOW THAT A

LOT OF ON PREMISE WORKLOADS
TODAY RUN ON VMWARE. NOW,

ACTUALLY, IT TURNS OUT MANY
CUSTOMERS ARE ACTUALLY HAPPY FOR

A PORTION OF THEIR EXISTING
VMWARE WORKLOADS TO STAY RUNNING

ON VMWARE, BUT THEY DON'T WANT
THEM TO STAY RUNNING IN THEIR

DATA CENTERS. THEY'D LIKE TO
MIGRATE THOSE TO THE CLOUD. AND

FOR THESE WORKLOADS. LAST WEEK,
WE ANNOUNCED OUR NEW ELASTIC

VMWARE SERVICE THAT MAKES IT
EASY FOR YOU TO MOVE VM VMWARE

SUBSCRIPTIONS TO AWS AND EASILY
RUN THE FULL VCF STACK OF VMWARE

NATIVELY ON TOP OF EC2. HOWEVER,
THERE'S A LOT OF WORKLOADS THAT

ARE CURRENTLY RUNNING OFTEN
TIMES ON VMWARE THAT CUSTOMERS

WOULD REALLY LOVE TO MODERNIZE.
THE CLOUD NATIVE SERVICES. NOW,

WE KNOW VMWARE IS DEEPLY
ENTRENCHED IN YOUR DATA CENTERS

WE KNOW VMWARE IS DEEPLY
ENTRENCHED IN YOUR DATA CENTERS

AND HAS BEEN FOR A REALLY LONG
TIME. AND WHAT HAPPENS IS IN

THIS VMWARE ENVIRONMENT, BECAUSE
IT'S BEEN THERE FOR A LONG TIME,

THERE ENDS UP THAT THERE'S THIS
KIND OF SPAGHETTI MESS OF

INTERCONNECTED APPLICATIONS. AND
SO IT'S ACTUALLY REALLY THE

HARDEST PART ABOUT MODERNIZING
IS FINDING OUT WHAT ARE THOSE

DEPENDENCIES OF THOSE
APPLICATIONS. AND THE MIGRATIONS

ARE ERROR PRONE BECAUSE IT'S
HARD TO UNDERSTAND THAT IF YOU

MOVE SOMETHING, IS IT GOING TO
BREAK SOMETHING ELSE? AND AGAIN,

OF COURSE, LICENSING IS
EXPENSIVE. WE'RE PLEASED TO

ANNOUNCE TODAY CU TRANSFORMATION
FOR VMWARE WORKLOADS.

[APPLAUSE]
NOW CU IS ABLE TO HELP YOU

EASILY MODERNIZE WORKLOADS THAT
ARE RUNNING ON VMWARE AND MOVE

THEM TO A CLOUD NATIVE SOLUTION.
WHAT HAPPENS IS, AND THE BIGGEST

VALUE HERE IS CU AUTOMATICALLY
IDENTIFIES ALL OF YOUR

APPLICATION DEPENDENCIES, AND IT
GENERATES THIS MIGRATION PLAN

FOR YOU, WHICH REALLY REDUCES A
TON OF THE MIGRATION TIME AND

SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCES YOUR RISK.
IT THEN ALSO LAUNCHES AGENTS

THAT CAN CONVERT YOUR ON PREMISE
VMWARE NETWORK CONFIGURATIONS

INTO MODERN AWS EQUIVALENTS.
THIS TAKES WHAT USED TO BE

MONTHS AND MONTHS OF WORK INTO
HOURS TO WEEKS. NOW I'M REALLY I

WANTED TO QUICKLY TOUCH BASE. WE
DID WINDOWS, WE DID VMWARE. BUT

THERE'S ONE COMPLEX SYSTEM
THAT'S BY FAR THE MOST DIFFICULT

TO MIGRATE TO THE CLOUD, AND
THAT'S THE MAINFRAME. EVEN JUST

THE EFFORT. ACTUALLY, IT TURNS
OUT WHEN WE TALK TO CUSTOMERS,

JUST THE EFFORT OF TRYING TO
ANALYZE AND DOCUMENT AND PLAN

MAINFRAME MODERNIZATION IS OFTEN
TOO MUCH. PEOPLE GIVE UP. IT'S

TOO HARD. IT CAN JUST BE
OVERWHELMING. IT TURNS OUT CU IS

REALLY GOOD AND CAN HELP WITH
THIS TOO. TODAY, ANNOUNCING CU

TRANSFORMATION FOR MAINFRAME.
[APPLAUSE]

CU HAS A NUMBER OF AGENTS THAT
CAN HELP YOU STREAMLINE THIS

COMPLEX WORKFLOW. CAN DO CODE
ANALYSIS FOR YOU. YOU CAN DO

PLANNING, REFACTOR YOUR
APPLICATIONS. AND ACTUALLY, JUST

LIKE I TALKED ABOUT BEFORE, MOST
OF MAINFRAME CODE IS NOT VERY

WELL DOCUMENTED. PEOPLE HAVE
MILLIONS OF LINES OF COBOL CODE

AND THEY HAVE NO IDEA WHAT IT
DOES. CU CAN ACTUALLY TAKE THAT

LEGACY CODE AND BUILD REAL TIME
DOCUMENTATION THAT LETS YOU KNOW

WHAT THIS DOES. REALLY COOL AND
SUPER HELPFUL IN UNDERSTANDING

WHICH OF THOSE APPLICATIONS YOU
WANT TO MODERNIZE. NOW, MOST

CUSTOMERS THAT YOU TALK TO WILL
TELL YOU THAT THEIR MAINFRAME

MIGRATION, THEY ESTIMATE, WILL
PROBABLY TAKE 3 TO 5 YEARS. I

DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU, BUT
PLANNING A PROJECT FOR 3 TO 5

YEARS IS NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE. A
LOT OF TIME THEY JUST DON'T GET

DONE. BUT NOW. AND BY THE WAY, I
WISH I COULD STAND UP HERE AND

TELL YOU THAT I'M GOING TO MAKE
MAINFRAME MIGRATIONS ONE CLICK.

WE'RE NOT QUITE THERE YET, AND
THAT'S NOT REALLY POSSIBLE YET.

BUT BASED ON EARLY CUSTOMER
FEEDBACK AND INTERNAL TESTING,

WE THINK THAT CU CAN ACTUALLY
TURN WHAT WAS GOING TO BE A

MULTI-YEAR EFFORT INTO LIKE A
MULTI-QUARTER EFFORT CUTTING BY

MORE THAN 50% THE TIME TO
MIGRATE MAINFRAMES, SUPER BIG.

IF YOU CAN TAKE A MULTI-YEAR
EFFORT AND BRING IT DOWN TO A

COUPLE OF QUARTERS, THAT'S
SOMETHING THAT PEOPLE CAN REALLY

GET THEIR HEADS AROUND AND
CUSTOMERS ARE INCREDIBLY EXCITED

ABOUT THIS ALL RIGHT. THE LAST
PART OF THE DEV CYCLE THAT WE

HAVEN'T TALKED ABOUT YET IS
OPERATIONS. NOW, WE ALL KNOW

THAT OPERATIONS ARE A CRITICAL
PART OF RUNNING SOFTWARE

SERVICES TODAY. AND WE HEAR FROM
CUSTOMERS THAT WHEN THEY'RE

MANAGING THEIR AWS ENVIRONMENT,
THEY SPEND A LOT OF TIME SIFTING

THROUGH CLOUDWATCH GRAPHS AND
LOGS, TRYING TO UNDERSTAND

WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THAT AWS
ENVIRONMENT. SO TODAY, I'M HAPPY

TO ANNOUNCE A NEW CAPABILITY IN
Q DEVELOPER, WHERE Q CAN NOW

MAKE IT EASY TO HELP INVESTIGATE
ISSUES INSIDE OF YOUR AWS

ENVIRONMENT.
[APPLAUSE]

WHAT Q CAN DO IS IT ACTUALLY
LOOKS AT YOUR ENTIRE

ENVIRONMENT. IT KNOWS YOUR
ENTIRE SETUP, EVERYTHING THAT

YOU HAVE RUNNING, AND THEN IT
LOOKS AT CLOUDWATCH DATA, IT

LOOKS AT CLOUDTRAIL LOGS. AND IT
CAN HELP YOU UNCOVER WHERE YOU

MAY BE HAVING AN ISSUE. IT
DEEPLY UNDERSTANDS YOUR AWS

ENVIRONMENT, AND IT LOOKS FOR
ANOMALIES. YOU MAY

SAY I'M HAVING AN ISSUE AND
IT'LL TRACE EVERYTHING DOWN TO

WHERE THERE'S A BROKEN SET OF
PERMISSIONS THAT MIGHT HAVE

GOTTEN CHANGED, AND IT'LL
SUGGEST HOW YOU CAN FIX THOSE.

AND MAYBE SUGGEST EVEN BEST
PRACTICES ON HOW YOU DON'T BREAK

AND MAYBE SUGGEST EVEN BEST
PRACTICES ON HOW YOU DON'T BREAK

THEM THE NEXT TIME. BECAUSE ONCE YOU SETTLE

ON THOSE ROOT CAUSES, Q ALSO HAS
ACCESS TO POSSIBLE REMEDIATIONS

FROM RUNBOOKS AND CURATED
DOCUMENTATION THAT YOU PROVIDE.

NOW, CLOUDWATCH HAS INTEGRATIONS
ACROSS MANY OF THE MOST POPULAR

INCIDENT MANAGEMENT AND
TICKETING SYSTEMS. ALSO, TO HELP

YOU MANAGE INCIDENTS ACROSS YOUR
ENTIRE LANDSCAPE. ONE PARTNER,

WHO I'M SURE MANY OF US USE
THAT'S INTEGRATED WITH Q IS

PAGERDUTY THEY'VE BEEN HELPING
CUSTOMERS PREVENT AND RESOLVE

OPERATIONAL EVENTS FOR MANY
YEARS, AND AWS HAS BEEN PROUD TO

PARTNER WITH THEM THROUGHOUT
THAT ENTIRE JOURNEY HERE. TO

TELL US MORE ABOUT HOW THEY'RE
INNOVATING FOR THE FUTURE AND

EMBRACING NEW TECHNOLOGIES LIKE
AI IS CEO OF PAGERDUTY JEN

TEJADA. JEN.
[MUSIC]

[MUSIC]
HOW ARE WE DOING?

[APPLAUSE]
THANKS, MATT. IT IS SO GREAT TO

BE HERE. SO WHO IS PAGERDUTY AND
NO, WE DON'T MAKE ANY PAGERS. I

USUALLY LAUNCH INTO THIS HISTORY
OF DEVOPS AND IT'S A CULTURE OF

ACCOUNTABILITY AND OWNERSHIP.
I'M A REAL HIT AT COCKTAIL

PARTIES, BUT THIS IS ONE PARTY
WHERE NO EXPLANATIONS ARE

NEEDED. IN FACT, I BET MANY OF
YOU ARE ON PAGERDUTY NOW. THAT

SAID, YOU MAY THINK YOU KNOW
PAGERDUTY, BUT YOU MIGHT NOT

REALLY KNOW US. WE WERE FOUNDED
15 YEARS AGO BY THREE AMAZON

SOFTWARE ENGINEERS SEEKING TO
SOLVE A SINGLE PAINFUL PROBLEM

AUTOMATING ON CALL AT THE TIME,
IT WAS THE LAST MILE IN DEVOPS.

IN THE DEVOPS IN SCALING DEVOPS.
THIS WAS JUST THE FIRST STEP

TODAY, GETTING THE RIGHT
EXPERTISE ORCHESTRATED TO THE

HIGHEST PRIORITY PROBLEM
RELIABLY AND QUICKLY REMAINS

CRITICAL. IT CAN BE THE
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HAPPY

CUSTOMERS OR MILLIONS IN LOST
REVENUES. PAGERDUTY OPERATIONS

CLOUD IS AGNOSTIC, INDEPENDENT
AND CENTRAL TO THE TECHNOLOGY

ECOSYSTEM. IT'S LIKE THE BRAIN
FOR YOUR DIGITAL OPERATIONS. IT

CONNECTS WITH OVER 700 INDUSTRY
LEADING APPLICATIONS, SERVING AS

A MODERN OPERATIONS HUB. OUR AI
FIRST SUITE OF PRODUCTS

LIBERATES DEVELOPERS FROM MANUAL
TOIL. OUR PLATFORM ENABLES TEAMS

TO INNOVATE FASTER,
AUTOMATICALLY DETECTING EVENTS,

FILTERING NOISE, AND
INTELLIGENTLY ORCHESTRATING

RESOLUTION AMONG PEOPLE,
MACHINES AND INCREASINGLY,

AGENTS. FOR NEARLY A DECADE,
WE'VE USED AWS, AI, AND

AUTOMATION TO DELIVER RESILIENCE
AND SECURITY AT SCALE. OUR SLAS

GO BEYOND APP AVAILABILITY TO
DATA TRANSIT, AND WE'VE NEVER,

EVER HAD A MAINTENANCE WINDOW.
INCIDENT MANAGEMENT AND

OPERATIONS MORE BROADLY ARE TIME
SENSITIVE, UNSTRUCTURED, AND

MISSION CRITICAL. MAKING THEM
FERTILE GROUND FOR AI AND

AUTOMATION. WE'VE APPLIED THAT
INSIGHT TO OPERATIONS, TURNING

EVERY PAGERDUTY INTERACTION INTO
AN OPPORTUNITY FOR SMARTER

DECISIONS, FASTER RESOLUTION,
AND MORE RESILIENT SERVICES

WHILE SHIFTING LEFT, YOU CAN
ALSO SCALE UP TO THE RIGHT OF

THE OPERATIONS MATURITY CURVE.
OUR FOUNDATIONAL DATA MODEL

INGESTS BILLIONS OF EVENTS AND
MILLIONS OF INCIDENT WORKFLOWS,

UNDERPINNED BY 15 YEARS OF
EXPERIENCE SERVING RESPONDERS TO

INCREASINGLY TAKE THAT HIGH COST
TOIL OFF YOUR HANDS. TODAY, OVER

TWO THIRDS OF THE FORTUNE 100
AND HALF OF THE FORTUNE 500 RELY

ON PAGERDUTY AS WELL AS A NUMBER
OF THE MOST INNOVATIVE

GENERATIVE AI NATIVES. OUR
COMMITMENT TO RELIABILITY,

FIDELITY AND SECURITY AT SCALE
HAS EARNED US THE TRUST OF OVER

15,000 CUSTOMERS, NEARLY 6000 OF
WHICH WE SHARE WITH AWS. WHEN I

WAS A KID, MY DAD'S ADVICE WAS
CHOOSE YOUR PARTNERS WISELY.

AFTER ALL, WE'RE A PRODUCT OF
THE PEOPLE WHO SURROUND US.

BUILDING PAGERDUTY ON AWS AND
PARTNERING WITH THEM TO

CO-INNOVATE WAS ONE OF THE BEST
BUSINESS DECISIONS WE'VE EVER

MADE, NOT THE LEAST OF WHICH
BECAUSE THE AWS COMMUNITY IS OUR

COMMUNITY. YOU'RE OUR KIND OF
PEOPLE. WITH AWS, WE'VE

INSTANTIATED HIGH AVAILABILITY
AND RESILIENCE WITHOUT

SACRIFICING EFFICIENCY AND
EFFECTIVENESS, MAINTAINING HIGH

GROSS MARGINS ABOVE 80% AS WE
SCALE. AND WE'VE DONE SO WITH

THE HELP OF MANY AWS BUILDING
BLOCKS LIKE AMAZON S3,

EVENTBRIDGE, AND LAMBDA. SO IT
WAS NATURAL TO WORK WITH AWS IN

HARNESSING GENERATIVE AI TO
SUPERCHARGE YOUR RESILIENT

INFRASTRUCTURE AND APPLICATIONS.
HERE'S HOW IT WORKS. IMAGINE YOU

BUILD CONSUMER APPS FOR A GLOBAL
BANK. IT'S LATE SUNDAY WHEN YOU

RECEIVE A PAGERDUTY ALERT.
CUSTOMERS ARE REPORTING LOGIN

ISSUES. YOUR MANAGER TEXTS YOU A
PHOTO OF IT GOING VIRAL ON

SOCIAL MEDIA. YOU KNOW FROM
EXPERIENCE THAT THIS COULD

QUICKLY DEVOLVE INTO CHAOS.
MULTIPLE SLACK THREADS, EMAILS,

CALLS, WAY TOO MANY PEOPLE ON
BRIDGES, AND MAYBE A FEW WAR

ROOMS ACROSS DIFFERENT
CONTINENTS. HOURS OF STRESS,

TRIAL AND ERROR, A SLEEPLESS
NIGHT. MANY OF US HAVE BEEN

THERE, BUT WITH THE PAGERDUTY
OPERATIONS CLOUD, THINGS CAN BE

DIFFERENT. YOU OPEN A SINGLE
INTEGRATED SLACK, CHAT WITH YOUR

SMALL TEAM OF EXPERTS. PAGERDUTY
ADVANCE OUR GENERATIVE AI

ASSISTANT BUILT USING AMAZON,
BEDROCK AND ANTHROPIC CLAUDE

ANSWERS DIAGNOSTIC QUESTIONS
LIKE WHAT'S THE CUSTOMER IMPACT?

WHAT'S CHANGED? THE PAGERDUTY
OPERATIONS CLOUD PROVIDES REAL

TIME VISIBILITY ACROSS ALL TYPES
OF TELEMETRY, INCLUDING CLOUD

APPLICATION, INFRASTRUCTURE AND
SECURITY EVENTS, AND IT

INSTANTLY IDENTIFIES A ROUTINE
THIRD PARTY UPDATE AS THE LIKELY

CULPRIT. BUT IT DOESN'T STOP
THERE. PAGERDUTY ADVANCE

PROACTIVELY SUGGESTS THE BEST
NEXT STEP. WITH A CLICK OF A

BUTTON, YOU DEPLOY AN AUTOMATED
RUNBOOK THAT ROLLS BACK THE

UPDATE AND RESTORES THE SERVICE.
WHO IN SECONDS OUR AI ASSISTANT

ALSO DRAFTS AN EXEC READY STATUS
UPDATE TO KEEP YOUR INTERNAL AND

EXTERNAL STAKEHOLDERS INFORMED,
SAVING TIME WHEN TIME IS OF THE

ESSENCE, YOUR CUSTOMER SERVICE
TEAM IS IN LOCKSTEP AND THEY'RE

ABLE TO FOLLOW AND ENGAGE WITH
PAGERDUTY WITHIN THEIR

SALESFORCE ENVIRONMENT AND USERS
ARE AUTOMATICALLY UPDATED THAT

THE ISSUE HAS BEEN RESOLVED. NOW
CUSTOMERS ARE ABLE TO LOG IN,

BUT WHEN THEY REVIEW THEIR
BANKING ACCOUNTS, MANY OF THEM

ARE STARTLED TO FIND ZEROS. THIS
IS A MORE COMPLEX ISSUE THAN IT

INITIALLY SEEMED, SO IT'S CLEAR
YOU NEED A LOT MORE CONTEXT, AND

IT'S ALSO CLEAR THAT TIME IS NOT
ON YOUR SIDE. LET'S FACE IT, THE

MATH IS NOT ON YOUR SIDE EITHER.
MAJOR INCIDENTS ARE UP 43% OVER

LAST YEAR, COSTING NEARLY $1
MILLION ON AVERAGE, SO YOU DON'T

HAVE A LOT OF TIME TO SEARCH
AROUND FOR PEOPLE AND

INFORMATION AND SEND EMAILS AND
RACE TICKETS AND SUPPORT CASES

ARE NOW SKYROCKETING. YOUR BOSS
IS TEXTING AGAIN NOW ABOUT

COMPLIANCE, CONTRACTUAL
OBLIGATIONS, AND THEN THE ISSUE

HITS THE NEWS. CUSTOMER LOYALTY,
REPUTATION, EVEN YOUR COMPANY'S

RIGHT TO DO BUSINESS ARE NOW ALL
AT STAKE. HIGH PRIORITY

INCIDENTS OFTEN IMPACT SEVERAL
DISTRIBUTED DEVELOPMENT TEAMS

AND A VARIETY OF OWNED AND THIRD
PARTY APPLICATIONS AND

INFRASTRUCTURE SERVICES, SO IT'S
VERY TIME CONSUMING TO FIND THE

RIGHT RESOURCES TO FIX THE
ISSUE. THAT'S WHY TODAY, WE'RE

PROUD TO ANNOUNCE THE COMBINED
POWER OF PAGERDUTY ADVANCE AND

AMAZON Q TOGETHER FOR THE FIRST
TIME.

[APPLAUSE]
WITH PAGERDUTY ADVANCE

INTEGRATED AMAZON Q, EVERYTHING
YOU NEED IS RIGHT AT YOUR

FINGERTIPS FROM IDENTIFYING,
CONTRIBUTING FACTORS TO

DIAGNOSTICS, THE DATA YOU SHARED
WITH YOU IS AVAILABLE FOR YOU IN

A SAFE AND SECURE ENVIRONMENT.
THE MOMENT THAT YOU NEED IT. THE

PAGERDUTY ADVANCE UNIFIED USER
EXPERIENCE, BUILT ON BEDROCK AND

CLAUDE AND INTEGRATED INTO Q,
MEANS LESS TIME LOST TO

INCIDENTS AND MORE TIME FOR
BUILDING. TRUST IS EARNED OVER

YEARS, BUT IT CAN BE LOST IN
SECONDS. GENERATIVE AI AND

AUTOMATION ARE POWERFUL
ACCELERATORS, BUT WE DO NEED

SAFEGUARDS, AND THAT'S WHY
PAGERDUTY LEVERAGES AMAZON

BEDROCK GUARDRAILS. GUARDRAILS
HELPS PROTECT AGAINST

HALLUCINATIONS, BLOCKS UNDESIRED
TOPICS, AND MINIMIZES HARMFUL

CONTENT. AND IN ADDITION TO
HELPING YOU MANAGE INCIDENTS

CAUSED BY AI AND AGENTS, WE CAN
ALSO HELP YOU RE:INFORCE YOUR

RESPONSIBLE AI POLICIES. THE
POTENTIAL OF AI IS UNDENIABLE.

WITH DISRUPTION COMES BOTH
OPPORTUNITY AND RESPONSIBILITY.

AWS AND PAGERDUTY ARE DEDICATED
TO PUTTING AI TO WORK IN

INNOVATIVE WAYS, WHILE NEVER
LOSING SIGHT OF WHAT GOT US

HERE. EARNING YOUR TRUST THROUGH
INNOVATION, SCALABILITY, AND

RELIABILITY. TOGETHER, WE'RE
PAVING THE WAY FOR A MORE SECURE

AND MORE RESILIENT AND BRIGHT
FUTURE. THANK YOU.

[APPLAUSE]
[MUSIC]

THANKS, JEN. I'M SURE THAT THERE
ARE MANY DEVELOPERS OUT THERE

THAT ARE SLEEP BETTER AT NIGHT,
KNOWING THEY HAVE PAGERDUTY. ALL

RIGHT. WE'VE SPENT A BUNCH OF
TIME TALKING ABOUT HOW WE CAN

HELP DEVELOPERS, BUT IT TURNS
OUT DEVELOPERS ARE NOT THE ONLY

PEOPLE THAT CAN SEE INCREDIBLE
GAINS FROM GENERATIVE AI. WE

THOUGHT WE COULD ALSO IMPROVE
THE EFFICIENCY OF OTHER ROLES IN

A COMPANY, ROLES LIKE FINANCE OR
SALES OR OPERATIONS, BY HELPING

AUTOMATE REPETITIVE TIME
CONSUMING AND FRANKLY,

UNFULFILLING TASKS. AND ONE
THREAD ACROSS ALL OF THOSE

DIFFERENT ROLES, WHEN WE TALK TO
PEOPLE WAS THAT PEOPLE SPEND A

LOT OF TIME LOOKING FOR DATA,
RIGHT? THEY WANT TO FIND DATA TO

MAKE DECISIONS, BUT IT'S IN
DIFFERENT APPS AND THEY GO BACK

AND FORTH AND IT'S REALLY HARD
TO GET IT ALL TOGETHER. AND

THAT'S THE REASON WHY WE
LAUNCHED Q BUSINESS. Q IS THE

MOST CAPABLE, GENERATIVE AI
ASSISTANT FOR LEVERAGING YOUR

COMPANY'S INTERNAL DATA AND
ACCELERATING TASK. WHAT Q DOES,

IS IT CONNECTS ALL YOUR
DIFFERENT BUSINESS SYSTEMS, YOUR

SOURCES OF ENTERPRISE DATA,
WHETHER THOSE COME FROM AWS,

WHETHER THEY'RE FROM THIRD PARTY
APPS, WHETHER FROM INTERNAL

SOURCES LIKE WIKIS, ALL OF
THOSE, ALL OF THIS DATA CAN THEN

BE USED TO DO BETTER SEARCHES.
IT CAN DO SUMMARIZATION OF YOUR

DATA, AND IT LETS YOU ENGAGE IN
A CONVERSATION WITH ALL OF YOUR

ENTERPRISE DATA ACROSS YOUR
VARIOUS DATA SILOS. AND IT'S ALL

DONE WITH SECURITY AND PRIVACY.
ALL OF THE PERMISSIONING AROUND

THAT DATA STAYS WITH, WITH YOUR
DATA. CUSTOMERS LIKE NASDAQ,

PRINCIPAL FINANCIAL AND
ACCENTURE USE Q BUSINESS TO

EMPOWER THEIR WORKFORCE TO BE
MUCH MORE PRODUCTIVE WITH

GENERATIVE AI. NOW, THE POWER OF
Q BUSINESS IS THAT IT CREATES

THIS INDEX OF ALL OF YOUR
ENTERPRISE DATA. SO IT INDEXES

DATA FROM ADOBE, FROM ATLASSIAN,
FROM MICROSOFT OFFICE, FROM

SHAREPOINT, FROM GMAIL, FROM
SALESFORCE, FROM SERVICENOW, AND

MORE. AND Q KEEPS THIS INDEX
ALWAYS UP TO DATE, AND IT'S

HIGHLY SECURE. MAINTAINING USER
LEVEL PERMISSIONS ON ALL OF THAT

DATA. SO IF YOU DON'T HAVE DATA
TO ACCESS, IF YOU DON'T HAVE

PERMISSION TO ACCESS DATA
OUTSIDE OF Q, YOU WON'T BE ABLE

TO ACCESS IT INSIDE OF Q ALL OF
ITS CONTROLLED AND COMPLIANT.

NOW, BY BRINGING ALL OF THESE
STORAGE AND APPS AND

PRODUCTIVITY AND CORPORATE
KNOWLEDGE BASES, ALL TOGETHER,

WE'RE DOING THIS IN A WAY THAT
NO ONE HAS DONE THIS BEFORE, AND

WE'RE RAPIDLY EXPANDING THE
NUMBER OF DATA TYPES THAT WE CAN

SUPPORT, INTEGRATING LOTS OF NEW
INFORMATION LIKE METADATA, A NEW

FILE, TYPES LIKE AUDIO AND
IMAGES, WHICH ARE COMING SOON.

BUT IT TURNS OUT THAT IT'S ALSO
NOT JUST ABOUT INTEGRATING DATA

FROM ALL YOUR PRODUCTIVITY AND
YOUR SAAS APPS. CUSTOMERS ALSO

ARE INTERESTED IN QUERYING THEIR
STRUCTURED DATA, AND MANY

COMPANIES HAVE THIS STRUCTURED
DATA TODAY IN DATABASES AND DATA

WAREHOUSES. AND TODAY, AS YOU
KNOW, THE VAST MAJORITY OF THIS

INFORMATION IS ACCESSED THROUGH
BUSINESS INTELLIGENCE SYSTEMS.

OVER 100,000 CUSTOMERS TODAY ARE
USING QUICKSIGHT FOR THEIR

ANALYTICS NEEDS. USING
QUICKSIGHT INTERACTIVE

DASHBOARDS, PIXEL PERFECT
REPORTS, AND EMBEDDED ANALYTICS.

LAST YEAR, WE PUT Q AND
QUICKSIGHT TO MAKE IT MUCH

EASIER FOR YOU TO GET FAST
GENERATIVE AI POWERED INSIGHTS.

YOU CAN ASK QUESTIONS DIRECTLY
ABOUT YOUR DATA AND GET GRAPHS

AND INFORMATION BACK. NOW WHAT
IF WE COULD BRING THIS ALL

TOGETHER, RIGHT? WHAT IF WE
COULD TAKE ALL OF THE

INFORMATION THAT'S IN YOUR BI
SYSTEMS? THE STRUCTURED DATA

STORE, AND BRING IT TOGETHER
WITH ALL THAT INFORMATION THAT'S

STORED IN THE Q INDEX DOCUMENTS
AND PURCHASE ORDERS AND EMAIL,

YOU COULD PROBABLY MAKE BETTER
DECISIONS IF WE UNIFIED ALL OF

THAT DATA. SO TODAY I'M EXCITED
TO ANNOUNCE THAT WE'RE BRINGING

TOGETHER QUICKSIGHT Q AND THE Q
BUSINESS DATA ALL TOGETHER.

[APPLAUSE]
SO REALLY, WHAT DOES THIS MEAN?

IMAGINE YOU'RE LOOKING AT A
QUICKSIGHT DASHBOARD, RIGHT. AND

SAY THIS IS A QUICKSIGHT
DASHBOARD. YOU BUILT THAT SHOW

YOUR SALES. NOW THAT'S PRETTY
INTERESTING AND IT'S USEFUL. AND

YOU CAN SEE WHAT YOUR SALES ARE
DOING. BUT MAYBE YOU ALSO WANT

TO ADD INFORMATION FROM YOUR
SALES PIPELINE. AND YOU KNOW

WHAT? IT ACTUALLY WOULD BE
INTERESTING AS YOU'RE LOOKING AT

THAT, TO REFER BACK TO THAT
MONTHLY BUSINESS REVIEW THAT YOU

DID LAST WEEK WHERE THE TEAM WAS
TALKING ABOUT SOME OF THE

INTERESTING TRENDS THAT THEY SAW
IN THE INDUSTRY. NOW, WITH

QUICKSIGHT AND Q BUSINESS, YOU
CAN PULL SALESFORCE DATA FROM

YOUR PIPELINE INTO YOUR
QUICKSIGHT REPORT. YOU CAN PULL

THE LATEST DETAILS FROM YOUR
ADOBE EXPERIENCE MANAGER, EMAIL

CAMPAIGN, OR YOU CAN GRAB THAT
LAST BUSINESS REVIEW FROM

SHAREPOINT AND YOU CAN USE ON Q
WILL USE ALL OF THAT DATA TO

SUMMARIZE IT TOGETHER AND SHOW
IT TO YOU ALL IN ONE VIEW. ALL

INSIDE OF QUICKSIGHT, MAKING
QUICKSIGHT MUCH MORE POWERFUL BY

PULLING INFORMATION IN FROM
OTHER SOURCES OF ENTERPRISE DATA

THAT YOU HAVE. IT'S REALLY COOL,
AND IT MAKES QUICKSIGHT MUCH,

MUCH MORE POWERFUL AS A BI TOOL.
SO WE DID THAT AND WE GOT THIS

THINKING, THIS Q INDEX THAT WE
HAVE, IT'S ACTUALLY AN

INCREDIBLY POWERFUL CONCEPT FOR
YOU AS A COMPANY. THIS CAN ACT

AS A CANONICAL DATA SOURCE FOR
ALL SOURCES OF YOUR ENTERPRISE

DATA. AND BECAUSE YOU HAVE Q
RIGHT. IN THEORY, THESE OTHER

APPLICATIONS, LIKE QUICKSIGHT,
CAN GET MORE POWERFUL LIKE WE

DID. THEY CAN PULL THAT IN AND
YOU GET MUCH MORE VALUE OUT OF

THE OTHER APPLICATIONS YOU'RE
USING. AND BECAUSE THIS INDEX IS

MANAGED BY AWS, YOU KNOW THAT
WE'VE THOUGHT DEEPLY ABOUT HOW

YOU GIVE YOU FINE GRAINED
CONTROL OVER THAT DATA. SO

APPLICATIONS WON'T BE ABLE TO
ACCESS THAT DATA WITHOUT YOUR

PERMISSIONS. AND THE RIGHT
PEOPLE WILL ONLY HAVE ACCESS TO

THE RIGHT SETS OF DATA. AND SO
WE ASKED OURSELVES, WHY STOP

WITH AWS APPLICATIONS? SO WE
WENT AND TALKED TO A COUPLE OF

CUSTOMERS AND AS WELL AS SOME OF
OUR ISV PARTNERS, AND WE SAID,

WHAT IF WE COULD GIVE YOU THE
SAME ACCESS TO THIS Q INDEX THAT

WE GAVE TO QUICKSIGHT, AND YOU
COULD JUST SEE THEIR EYES LIGHT

UP. THEY COULD SEE THAT THE
VALUE THEY COULD GET OUT OF

THOSE THIRD PARTY APPLICATIONS,
OR FROM THE APPLICATION

DEVELOPER, THE VALUE THEY COULD
PROVIDE TO THEIR CUSTOMERS WAS

IMMENSE. IF THEY COULD PULL IN
THESE OTHER SOURCES OF DATA. SO

I'M PLEASED TO ANNOUNCE THAT NOW
THERE'S A NEW SET OF APIS WHERE

ISVS CAN ACCESS THIS Q INDEX
THAT WE USE IN Q BUSINESS.

[APPLAUSE]
WHAT THAT MEANS FOR YOU ALL IS

WHEN YOU USE Q BUSINESS, IT
MAKES THE POTENTIAL FOR ALL THE

REST OF YOUR APPLICATIONS TO
ALSO GET BETTER. NOW IT COMES

WITH THIS FINE GRAINED
PERMISSIONS SO YOU CAN CONTROL

WHEN A THIRD PARTY APPLICATION.
MAYBE HAS ACCESS. BUT WHEN YOU

DO THAT, THOSE GET BETTER AND
MORE USEFUL. ISV APPS GET MORE

POWERFUL PERSONALIZED. IT ALLOWS
YOU TO SAVE TIME AND MONEY, AND

YOU DON'T HAVE TO RELY. IF THEY
WANTED ACCESS TO THAT DATA, YOU

DON'T WANT TO HAVE TO LET A
BUNCH OF OTHER ISVS ALL HAVE

ACCESS TO THAT DATA, AND ALL TRY
TO HANDLE PERMISSIONS. YOU KNOW

THAT AWS HAS THAT COVERED. AND
SO, YOU KNOW, SECURITY IS RIGHT

THERE WHEN YOU NEED IT.
COMPANIES LIKE ASANA AND MIRO

PAGERDUTY, AS YOU SAW SMARTSHEET
AND ZOOM ARE ALL ALREADY

BUILDING INTEGRATIONS TO THIS Q
INDEX. LET'S TAKE A QUICK LOOK

AND SEE HOW THIS MIGHT LOOK.
TAKE ASANA. ALL RIGHT. ASANA IS

A WORKFORCE MANAGEMENT SOFTWARE,
A WORK MANAGEMENT SOFTWARE

PROVIDER. RIGHT. AND THEY'VE
INTEGRATED WITH THE Q INDEX TO

SURFACE CONTENT FROM OTHER
APPLICATIONS IN THEIR PROJECT

MANAGEMENT APPLICATION. LET'S
PRETEND FOR A SECOND THEY ARE AN

IT LEADER, AND YOU'RE BUILDING A
NEW SET OF TOOLS USING ASANA.

HOWEVER, YOU CAN SEE THAT
UNFORTUNATELY YOUR PROJECT IS

OFF TRACK. WHAT HAPPENS IS ASANA
AI LEVERAGES THE Q INDEX TO

IDENTIFY THE PROBLEM. WHAT THEY
DO IS THEY LOOK AND THEY PULL

IDENTIFY THE PROBLEM. WHAT THEY
DO IS THEY LOOK AND THEY PULL

FROM YOUR YOUR YOUR TEAMS. CHAT
TRANSCRIPT. AND THEY SEE THAT

YOU DON'T HAVE A COMMITTED
TIMELINE FROM YOUR CTO FROM THE

FROM YOUR TEAMS CHAT. IT ALSO
FOUND FROM AN UNREAD GMAIL

MESSAGE THAT A KEY MEETING THAT
YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO MAKE

RELATED DECISIONS TO THIS
PROJECT ACTUALLY GOT PUSHED TO

NEXT WEEK, AND NOW YOU'RE LATE.
NOW, BECAUSE YOU'RE ABLE TO

INTEGRATE ALL THIS INFORMATION,
YOU KNOW WHERE TO FOCUS YOUR

TIME, AND YOU CAN TRY TO GET
THINGS BACK ON TRACK. PRETTY

COOL PULLING ALL THIS
INFORMATION. AWESOME. THIS PAST

YEAR, WE ALSO LAUNCHED A NEW
FEATURE IN Q CALLED Q APPS. Q

APPS MAKES IT EASY FOR YOU TO
QUICKLY AUTOMATE SMALL LITTLE

TASKS THAT MAKE YOUR DAILY LIFE
EASIER. ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS

YOU GO INTO Q APPS AND YOU
DESCRIBE THE APP YOU WANT

NATURAL LANGUAGE AND IT QUICKLY
GENERATES IT FOR YOU. AND BY THE

WAY, THESE ARE NOT MEANT FOR BIG
MAJOR APPLICATIONS, RIGHT? LIKE

SOMETHING LIKE AN ASANA OR
PAGERDUTY. THESE ARE JUST SMALL

LITTLE APPS THAT MIGHT BE ABLE
TO SAVE YOU 15 MINUTES A DAY.

LET'S SAY, FOR EXAMPLE, YOU'RE A
SOCIAL MEDIA MARKETER AND YOU

BUILD A QUICK APP TO TUNE YOUR COPY TO DIFFERENT

SITES, TEXT LIMITS AND AUDIENCE
PREFERENCES. SO TODAY, WHAT

HAPPENS IS YOU HAVE TO COME UP
WITH TEXT AND YOU MAYBE HAVE TO

ITERATE ON IT. A DOZEN, TWO
DOZEN, THREE DIFFERENT DOZEN

TIMES FOR THE DIFFERENT WEBSITES,
YOU CAN CREATE A LITTLE APP THAT

YOU ENTER AT ONE TIME. IT'LL
CREATE ALL OF THE DIFFERENT

COPIES FOR YOU. IT'S A SIMPLE
APP, BUT IT SAVES YOU A TON OF

TIME, AND YOU CAN IMAGINE THAT
IF YOU USE IT OVER AND OVER AND

OVER AGAIN ON A DAILY BASIS,
THAT CAN ADD UP. WE SEE

CUSTOMERS MAKING HUNDREDS AND
HUNDREDS OF THESE APPS ALL OF

THE TIME, AND SOMETIMES THEY
ACTUALLY CAN HAVE A PRETTY BIG

IMPACT. VOLKSWAGEN IS CURRENTLY
UPGRADING TO AN A NEW AIR

INFORMATION SYSTEM, AND LIKE
MANY LARGE CORPORATIONS, THEY

SAW THAT THEY HAD OVER 4000
DIFFERENT JOB CODES ALONE IN

NORTH AMERICA, AND THEY WERE
TRYING TO CONSOLIDATE THOSE DOWN

TO A FEW DOZEN STANDARDIZED JOB
CODES. SOMEONE ON THE ON THE

TEAM BUILT A Q APP TO DO THIS,
AND IT WAS SO HELPFUL. THEY

ACTUALLY ROLLED IT OUT TO THE
WHOLE TEAM. AND NOW THEY CAN

SAVE OVER 100,000 HOURS
WORLDWIDE BY USING THIS

CAPABILITY NEXT YEAR. WHAT A
WIN. ALL FROM AN APP THAT TOOK

ABOUT 5 TO 10 MINUTES TO CREATE
BY SOMEONE ON THEIR DESKTOP. SO

IF Q CAN HELP AUTOMATE JUST
THESE SIMPLE LITTLE WORKFLOWS,

WE THOUGHT MAYBE IT COULD HELP
WITH COMPLEX ONES TOO. AND EVERY

COMPANY HAS THESE REALLY COMPLEX
WORKFLOWS, RIGHT? THESE ARE

WORKLOADS THAT INVOLVE MULTIPLE
APPLICATIONS. THEY INVOLVE

APPROVALS THAT INVOLVE MANUAL
ENTRY. AND THESE THINGS ARE

PAINFUL. THEY'RE REALLY HARD TO
AUTOMATE. RIGHT. AND ACTUALLY

THIS IS NOT A NEW CONCEPT.
PEOPLE HAVE BEEN TRYING TO

AUTOMATE THESE STYLE OF
WORKLOADS FOR A LONG TIME. BUT

IT'S HARD BECAUSE USUALLY THEY
REQUIRE HUMAN INTERACTION.

THERE'S A UI, IF ANY ELEMENT OF
THE UI BREAKS, THE WHOLE

WORKFLOW BREAKS, AND YOU'RE DOWN
FOR WEEKS WHILE YOU GO TRY TO

REPAIR IT. AND THESE SYSTEMS ARE
BRITTLE AND THEY DON'T REALLY

WORK IN. THEY'RE EXPENSIVE TO
TRY TO GO BUILD. Q HAS A BETTER

WAY. HOWEVER, I'M VERY PLEASED
TO ANNOUNCE THAT COMING SOON, Q

BUSINESS AUTOMATE CAN HELP
AUTOMATE TASKS ACROSS MULTIPLE

TEAMS AND APPLICATIONS.
[APPLAUSE]

WHAT HAPPENS IS Q BUSINESS WILL
USE A SERIES OF ADVANCED AGENTS

TO CREATE, EDIT, AND MAINTAIN
WORKFLOWS, MAKING THEM MUCH MORE

RESILIENT TO CHANGE AND THEY'LL
DO ALL OF THIS AUTOMATICALLY.

LET'S SAY, FOR EXAMPLE, YOU TELL
Q BUSINESS THAT YOU WANT TO

AUTOMATE A COMPLEX, SAY, AUTO
CLAIM PROCESSING WORKFLOW. OKAY,

YOU SIMPLY YOU SIMPLY TELL IT
WHAT YOUR STANDARD OPERATING

PROCEDURE IS. IN FACT, YOU CAN
EVEN DO IS YOU CAN EVEN INSTALL

A BROWSER PLUGIN THAT WILL
FOLLOW ALONG AND, AND WATCH A

VIDEO OR MAKE A VIDEO AS YOU
MANUALLY ENTER THROUGH THE STEPS.

IT'LL THEN AUTOMATICALLY CREATE
THAT WORKFLOW. ASK YOU A COUPLE

OF QUESTIONS THAT IT DOESN'T
UNDERSTAND OF WHAT HAPPENED, AND

THEN IT'S DONE. NOW YOU HAVE AN
AUTOMATED WORKFLOW, AND AFTER

YOU LAUNCH THE WORKFLOW, THERE'S
A Q AGENT THAT WILL CONSTANTLY

MONITOR IT TO MAKE SURE THAT IT
ADJUSTS ON FINDING ANY UI

CHANGES THAT HAPPEN AND FIX THEM
ON THE FLY SO YOU DON'T HAVE ANY

DOWNTIME. PREVIOUSLY, THIS WOULD
HAVE TAKEN WEEKS OR MONTHS TO

DO, AND IT'S SOMETHING YOU CAN
NOW DO IN MINUTES. WE THINK THAT

WE'RE ONLY AT THE BEGINNING OF
THE AUTOMATION THAT Q BUSINESS

IS GOING TO HELP YOU ALL DO, AND
WE THINK IT'S GOING TO BE REALLY

IMPACTFUL FOR SAVING TIME FOR A
LOT OF THESE REALLY TEDIOUS

TASKS. NOW LET'S HEAR FROM
ANOTHER STARTUP COMPANY, A

COMPANY THAT'S BUILDING ON AWS
AND IS TAKING AUTOMATION TO A

WHOLE NEW LEVEL.
[MUSIC]

OUR PRECONCEIVED NOTION OF
ROBOTS IS THAT THEY LACK SOME

EMPATHY. THEY LACK SOME
INTERACTIVITY. I DON'T THINK IT

HAS TO BE THAT WAY.
[MUSIC]

I KOHL WE SEE A FUTURE WHERE
ROBOTS ARE HELPING IN EVERY

SECTOR.
[MUSIC]

THE ROBOTS HAVE TO BEHAVE IN A
VERY PREDICTABLE WAY. THE

SENSING, THE PERCEPTION, THE
SOFTWARE. SO IT'S CONNECTED ALL

THE WAY FROM THE CLOUD DOWN TO
THE PHYSICAL ACTUATION OF THE

WHEELS.
[MUSIC]

PROXY IS DESIGNED TO TAKE ON
THESE MATERIAL MOVEMENT TASKS TO

TAKE ON MOVING BOXES, TOTES AND
CARTS THAT CAN MOVE UP TO 1,500

POUND CARTS. AND YET IT'S A
FRIENDLY ROBOT. IT'S NOT AN

INDUSTRIAL MACHINE. IT'S NOT A
FORKLIFT. WITH THE ADVANCES IN

AI, WITH THE ADVANCES IN LARGE
LANGUAGE MODELS, WE HAVE THAT

ABILITY TO HAVE THAT MUCH MORE
EMPATHETIC INTERACTION. WE

DIDN'T INITIALLY THINK ABOUT.
HOW DO WE MAKE IT EASY TO PLUG

AND PLAY WITH DIFFERENT MODELS?
[MUSIC]

BUT AWS ANTICIPATED THAT FOR US,
AWS WITH BEDROCK HAD THE INSIGHT

THAT IT WOULDN'T COME FROM ONE
SOURCE.

[MUSIC]
AS THESE MODELS GET UPDATED, WE

GET ACCESS TO THEM ALMOST
IMMEDIATELY TO MAKE OUR ROBOT

BETTER AS TECHNOLOGISTS, AS
INVENTORS, WE GET THE ABILITY TO

DECIDE WHAT THE FUTURE LOOKS
LIKE. AI IS NOT ONLY GOING TO

CHANGE THE NATURE OF COGNITIVE
WORK, BUT IT'S GOING TO CHANGE

PHYSICAL WORK AS WELL.
[MUSIC]

ALL RIGHT, THAT IS SUPER
IMPRESSIVE BRAD. THOSE THOSE

ROBOTS ARE AWESOME. THANK YOU
FOR SHARING. ALL RIGHT. THERE'S

ONE AREA THAT WE HAVEN'T TOUCHED
ON YET TODAY. AND THAT'S

ANALYTICS IN AWS. WE HAVE THE
BROADEST AND DEEPEST SET OF

PURPOSE BUILT ANALYTICS
SERVICES. WE HAVE SERVICES FOR

DATA WAREHOUSING, DATA
PROCESSING, SEARCH ANALYTICS,

STREAMING ANALYTICS, BUSINESS
INTELLIGENCE AND MORE. AND JUST

TO HIGHLIGHT A FEW OF THESE,
REDSHIFT IS OUR CLOUD NATIVE

DATA WAREHOUSE. IT GIVES YOU
INDUSTRY LEADING PRICE

PERFORMANCE. IT'S USED BY TENS
OF THOUSANDS OF CUSTOMERS TODAY,

AND REDSHIFT PROCESSES EXABYTES
OF DATA EVERY SINGLE DAY. WE

HAVE EMR, WHICH IS OUR PETABYTE
SCALE BIG DATA PROCESSING

SERVICE, AND IT DELIVERS 3.9
TIMES THE PERFORMANCE THAT YOU

GET FROM OPEN SOURCE SPARK. WE
HAVE OPENSEARCH, WHICH GIVES YOU

EVERYTHING FROM LOG ANALYTICS TO
VECTOR SEARCH. IT'S A VERY

FLEXIBLE SERVICE AND THERE'S
TENS OF THOUSANDS OF ACTIVE

CUSTOMERS USING OPENSEARCH WITH
HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF

CLUSTERS SUPPORTED AND TRILLIONS
OF REQUESTS HANDLED EVERY MONTH.

AWS GLUE IS OUR SERVERLESS DATA
INTEGRATION SERVICE, WHICH DOES

HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DATA
INTEGRATION JOBS EVERY SINGLE

MONTH, AND INCREASINGLY, WE'RE
SEEING MORE AND MORE CUSTOMERS

START THEIR ANALYTICS WORKFLOWS
WITH SAGEMAKER. YOU HEARD THIS

FROM LAURIE ABOUT JPMC. WE'RE
SEEING CUSTOMERS USE SAGEMAKER

TO PROCESS AND PREPARE THEIR
DATA FOR ML WORKLOADS, AND AN ML

BASED ANALYSIS. AND ACTUALLY,
THIS LAST POINT IS SUPER

INTERESTING. A LOT OF CUSTOMERS
TELL US THAT THEIR ANALYTICS AND

THEIR AI WORKLOADS ARE
INCREASINGLY CONVERGING AROUND A

LOT OF THE SAME DATA AND A LOT
OF THE SAME WORKLOADS,

WORKFLOWS. IT'S ACTUALLY
CHANGING HOW CUSTOMERS THINK

ABOUT THEIR ANALYTICS SERVICES,
BECAUSE IT TURNS OUT YOU DON'T

JUST USE ANALYTICS AND AI TOOLS
IN ISOLATION ANYMORE. IN FACT, A

LOT OF CUSTOMERS ARE USING THEIR
HISTORICAL ANALYTICS DATA TO

TRAIN MACHINE LEARNING MODELS
AND INCREASINGLY THAT SAME DATA

IS THEN THEY INCORPORATE INTO
THEIR GENAI APPLICATIONS. SO

MANY PEOPLE ARE ALREADY USING
THESE SERVICES TOGETHER. THERE'S

A FINSERV CUSTOMER THAT I WAS
TALKING TO RECENTLY THAT WAS

BUILDING A REAL TIME FRAUD
DETECTION SYSTEM, AND THEY WERE

WALKING ME THROUGH THEIR
ARCHITECTURE AND THEY SAID,

LOOK, HERE'S WHAT I DO. I START
WITH A HOMEGROWN DATA CATALOG,

AND IT'S FOR ANALYSTS TO TRY TO
ACCESS THE DATA THEY NEED, AND

THEN THEY TAKE THAT DATA AND
THEY LOAD IT INTO REDSHIFT AND

THEIR DATA WAREHOUSE, AND THAT'S
WHERE THEY STORE IT. AND THEN

THEY RUN SQL ANALYTICS ON TOP OF
THAT DATA. AND THEN USING A

COMBINATION OF SAGEMAKER AND EMR,
THEY PASSED THIS OFF TO THEIR

DATA SCIENTISTS, WHO THEN USE
THOSE SYSTEMS TO PREPARE THE

TRAINING DATA. AND THEN TRAIN
AND DEPLOY THE FRAUD SYSTEMS. I

MODEL. IT'S ACTUALLY A PRETTY
COOL SYSTEM THAT THEY'VE BUILT,

AND IT TURNS OUT WITHOUT THESE
CLOUD SYSTEMS, THIS IS AN

OUTCOME THEY NEVER COULD HAVE
ACHIEVED, RIGHT? IT'S SOMETHING

THEY COULDN'T HAVE DONE BECAUSE
THEY GOT TO USE THE ABSOLUTE

BEST SERVICE FOR EACH ONE OF
THOSE STEPS. THE BEST TOOL FOR

THE RIGHT TIME. BUT AS WE
THOUGHT ABOUT THIS EXAMPLE AND

OTHERS LIKE IT, WE KEPT THINKING,
HOW COULD WE MAKE THIS EVEN

EASIER? WHAT IF WE STARTED FROM
A BLANK PIECE OF PAPER? WHAT

WOULD AN IDEAL AI AND ANALYTICS
SYSTEM LOOK LIKE? SO WE HAVE

FOUR RINGS HERE OF CAPABILITIES
THAT WE NEED. WE HAVE ALL OF THE

BEST ANALYTIC SERVICES. WE HAVE
AN EASY WAY TO UNDERSTAND AND

ALL OF YOUR DATA, WHETHER IT'S
STRUCTURED OR UNSTRUCTURED, ALL

ACROSS S3, REDSHIFT AND AURORA
AND THIRD PARTY DATA SOURCES,

YOU'D WANT TO BE ABLE TO TAKE
ADVANTAGE OF YOUR DATA

MANAGEMENT CAPABILITIES. THEN
DATAZONE TO DO THINGS LIKE

CATALOGING, SHARE CATALOG
SHARING AND GOVERNANCE OF YOUR

DATA. AND YOU'D WANT TO HAVE AI
FRONT AND CENTER OF EVERYTHING

THAT YOU DO. IT'S ALMOST LIKE WE
NEED THAT FIFTH RING JUST TO

PULL IT ALL TOGETHER TO AN
INTEGRATED EXPERIENCE. NOW,

TODAY, SAGEMAKER IS THE MOST
POPULAR SERVICE IN THE WORLD FOR

BUILDING, TRAINING AND DEPLOYING
ML MODELS. NOW, AS WE TALKED

ABOUT EARLIER, THE SECRET TO
BUILDING GREAT AI APPLICATIONS

IS CUSTOMIZING THEM WITH YOUR
OWN DATA. AND SAGEMAKER IS THE

CENTER OF HOW MOST CUSTOMERS DO
THAT TODAY. AND INCREASINGLY,

SAGEMAKER IS ACTUALLY THE CENTER
OF A LOT OF DATA, AI, AND DATA

ANALYSIS AS WELL. IN FACT, IT'S
THE DE FACTO WAY THAT WE SEE

CUSTOMERS DEALING WITH THEIR
DATA AND AI MODELS TOGETHER. AND

HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF
CUSTOMERS ARE ALREADY USING

SAGEMAKER TODAY. NOW WE'RE
PUTTING ALL OF THESE PIECES

TOGETHER, AND I'M SUPER EXCITED
TO NOW TO ANNOUNCE THE NEXT

GENERATION OF AMAZON SAGEMAKER.
[APPLAUSE]

SAGEMAKER IS NOW THE CENTER OF
ALL OF YOUR DATA ANALYTICS AND

AI NEEDS. WHAT WE'RE DOING IS
WE'RE TAKING THE SAGEMAKER THAT

YOU ALL KNOW AND LOVE AND
EXPANDING IT BY INTEGRATING THE

MOST COMPREHENSIVE SET OF DATA
ANALYTICS AND AI TOOLS.

EVERYTHING YOU NEED FOR FAST
ANALYTICS, DATA PROCESSING,

SEARCH DATAPREP AI MODEL
DEVELOPMENT, AND GENERATIVE AI

ALL WITH A SINGLE VIEW OF YOUR
ENTERPRISE DATA. AS PART OF

THIS, I'M ALSO EXCITED TO
ANNOUNCE THE SAGEMAKER UNIFIED

STUDIO.
[APPLAUSE]

IT'S A SINGLE DATA AND AI
DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT

AVAILABLE IN PREVIEW TODAY. IT
ALLOWS YOU TO ACCESS ALL THE

DATA IN YOUR ORGANIZATION AND
ACT ON IT WITH THE BEST TOOL FOR

THE JOB. IT CONSOLIDATES THE
FUNCTIONALITY THAT ANALYSTS AND

DATA SCIENTISTS USE ACROSS A
WIDE RANGE OF STANDALONE STUDIOS

IN AWS TODAY, A STANDALONE QUERY
EDITORS AND A VARIETY OF VISUAL

TOOLS THINGS LIKE EMR AND GLUE
AND REDSHIFT AND BEDROCK AND ALL

THE EXISTING SAGEMAKER STUDIO
CAPABILITIES. IT ALLOWS YOU TO

CREATE SHARED PROJECTS THAT
INCLUDE AI OR ANALYTICS

ARTIFACTS LIKE NOTEBOOKS OR
MODELS, AND ALLOWS YOUR DATA

SCIENTISTS AND YOUR ANALYSTS AND
ML EXPERTS TO ALL EASILY

COLLABORATE IN THE SAME
INTEGRATED SPACE. IT ALSO

INCLUDES AN INTEGRATED DATA
CATALOG AND GOVERNANCE

CAPABILITIES, WHICH ALLOWS AN
EASY WAY FOR YOU TO APPLY

SECURITY CONTROLS SO THAT
DIFFERENT USERS ALL ACROSS YOUR

ORGANIZATION CAN ACCESS THE
ARTIFACTS THAT THEY NEED, BUT

ONLY HAVE THE ONES THAT THEY
HAVE PERMISSION TO. SO HOW DO WE

DO THIS? WE FIRST HAD TO BREAK
DOWN THE DATA SILOS THAT WE HAVE.

AND AS YOU KNOW, THIS IS
MULTIPLE YEARS IN THE MAKING.

WE'VE BEEN ON A JOURNEY TOWARD
ZERO ETL FUTURE. WITH THIS

MOMENT IN MIND, ZERO-ETL
INTEGRATES ALL OF YOUR DATA

BETWEEN AURORA AND RDS AND
DYNAMODB AND REDSHIFT. AND WE

ALSO KNOW, THOUGH, THAT A LOT OF
YOUR CRITICAL DATA, AS WE'VE

TALKED ABOUT THROUGHOUT THE DAY,
LIVES IN POWERFUL THIRD PARTY

APPLICATIONS, WHICH MAKES IT
HARD TO USE ALL OF THIS DATA

TOGETHER BECAUSE IT'S SILOED. WE
WANTED TO MAKE THAT EASIER AS

WELL. SO TODAY WE'RE INTRODUCING
ZERO-ETL FOR APPLICATIONS, A NEW

CAPABILITY THAT LETS YOU ANALYZE
DATA STORED ACROSS MANY OF THE

MOST POPULAR THIRD PARTY SAAS
APPLICATIONS, ALL WITHOUT HAVING

TO BUILD AND MANAGE DATA
PIPELINES.

[APPLAUSE]
SO CUSTOMERS WANT TO DO

ANALYTICS ACROSS ALL OF THIS
DATA. AND AS WE ANNOUNCED

EARLIER TODAY, WE HAVE THIS NEW
ICEBERG CAPABILITY IN S3 THAT

MAKES IT MUCH EASIER TO QUERY
YOUR S3 DATA LAKE. BUT YOU WANT

A SINGLE INTERFACE ACROSS ALL OF
YOUR DATA, WHETHER IT'S

REDSHIFT, STRUCTURED DATA
SOURCES, OR S3 DATA LAKES OR

OTHER FEDERATED DATA SOURCES. SO
I'M VERY EXCITED TODAY TO

ANNOUNCE NEHA, THE AMAZON
SAGEMAKER LAKEHOUSE.

[APPLAUSE]
IT'S A NEW APACHE ICEBERG

COMPATIBLE LAKE HOUSE IN
SAGEMAKER THAT PROVIDES A

SIMPLE, UNIFIED ACCESS ACROSS
ALL OF THESE SOURCES OF DATA.

YOU CAN EASILY WORK WITH ALL OF
YOUR DATA RIGHT IN THE UNIFIED

STUDIO, OR YOU CAN ACTUALLY
ACCESS YOUR SAGEMAKER LAKEHOUSE

DIRECTLY FROM ANY THIRD PARTY AI
OR ANALYTICS TOOL OR QUERY

ENGINE THAT SUPPORTS APACHE
ICEBERG APIS. YOU CAN QUERY DATA

NO MATTER HOW OR WHERE IT'S
PHYSICALLY STORED, AND FOR ALL

OF THOSE USE CASES, WHETHER
THEY'RE ANALYTICS OR AD HOC

QUERYING, PROCESSING OR DATA
SCIENCE OR WHATEVER, IT'S ALL

THROUGH THIS CONSISTENT
INTERFACE. AND ALSO DON'T WORRY,

SAGEMAKER THAT YOU KNOW AND LOVE
STILL INCLUDES ALL OF THE

EXISTING AI CAPABILITIES THAT
YOU'VE COME TO USE. THINGS LIKE

DATA WRANGLING HUMAN IN THE LOOP,
GROUNDTRUTH EXPERIMENTS, MLOPS,

AND OF COURSE HYPERPOD MANAGED
DISTRIBUTED TRAINING. WE'RE NOW

REFERRING TO THIS AS SAGEMAKER
AI, AND THERE'S A TON OF NEW

LAUNCHES THAT ARE HAPPENING IN
SAGEMAKER AI THAT YOU'LL THAT

YOU'LL HEAR ABOUT THROUGHOUT THE
WEEK. SO LET'S BRING IT ALL BACK

TOGETHER. REMEMBER THAT FRAUD
DETECTION USE CASE THAT WE

STARTED WITH? LET'S SEE HOW WE
CAN IMPROVE THAT EXPERIENCE WITH

THE NEW UNIFIED STUDIO AND THE
NEW SAGEMAKER. NOW YOUR ANALYSTS

AND DATA SCIENTISTS HAVE ACCESS
TO A CONSOLIDATED SET OF

BUSINESS DATA CATALOGS. THEY CAN
NOW SEARCH FOR THE RELEVANT DATA

THAT THEY NEED FOR THEIR USE
CASE. IN THIS EXAMPLE, LET'S SAY

THE DATA ANALYST WANTS TO LOOK
FOR TRANSACTIONS. THEY CAN VIEW

DETAILS ABOUT THE DATA, AND THEY
CAN SUBSCRIBE TO ADD IT TO THEIR

PROJECT. NEXT, THEY CAN OPEN A
QUERY EDITOR, WHICH IS NATIVELY

INVOLVED IN THE UNIFIED UI. THIS
QUERY EDITOR ENABLES THEM TO

WRITE SQL QUERIES THAT THEY CAN
RUN AGAINST REDSHIFT OR ATHENA,

ALL WITHOUT HAVING TO LEAVE
SAGEMAKER, AND THEY CAN THEN
